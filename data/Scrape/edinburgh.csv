Long version is, I have been taking a few midnight walks about town, get out the house, stretch my legs and especially now the nice weather is here it's nice and peaceful at night. I get a podcast on my phone and wander the streets for an hour.

Foxes are 10 a penny at this point, tho at first they where interesting the novelty soon wore off and last night on a small patch of grass in Broughton area (I won't say exactly where) I saw what at first I thought was a fox, but it was a bit big so as it started to move I thought it was a shaggy posh cat. It was only when it turned and looked at me and I saw the stripy black and white face that I realised what it/he/she was. 

Needless to say my jaw dropped and before I knew what had happened the badger had bolted. No chance to take a photo and would not have approached anyway.  

I am a bit of a night owl and you do see foxes about and I have lived in suburbs and the countryside, but never in my puff have I seen a real live Badger knocking about on his nightly rounds. I'm assuming lockdown has something today with it, less food available for scavenging, less people, less cars.

I was living and studying in Edinburgh with a company called student cribs when coronavirus came along... i had lost my job only a few days before and was in the process of looking for a new one to pay my rent and then that was all sort of thwarted as covid came along. I knew I wouldn’t have the money to pay my rent or even to pay for food so I packed up my room, messaged the company with my notice and moved in with my parents to avoid having to pay my last few months of rent.


However, since then they have been hassling that I have to pay rent until the end of my contract. But I don’t have the money and surely this is a mitigating circumstance. Apparently it’s their policy that any tenant moving out must find their replacement to move in, but given the circumstance there is about a 0% chance of finding someone to move into my old flat.

So, I’m calling on anyone with an understanding of Edinburgh renting law or just the laws to do with renting from a company. I could really use the help, otherwise I’m going to have to get some sort of loan out.

Thanks very much guys"

My main request, that might be silly to some, is a diverse area. I'm a black queer woman married to a white man. Growing up in the UK in a white area I have dealt with a lot of blatant &amp; obvious racism. I want to find an area to settle down and have kids that's quite welcoming.

Statement: I'm not saying Scotland is racist etc, it's something, as a black woman, I am wary of where ever I go.

Thanks"

All of the issues around these things have deep roots both here and abroad and a lot of this is coming to the surface.

In Glasgow, streets named for people who profited from the slave trade were renamed after victims of Police Brutality and figures from Black history. Buchanan Street was renamed ""George Floyd Street"".

Slavery has a massive footprint on our cities and Edinburgh is no different. A lot of the New Town was built from Slavery money, but there is one figure who literally sticks out the most: [Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dundas,_1st_Viscount_Melville).

If you've been to St Andrew's Square, you're likely very familiar with the [Melville Monument](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Melville_Monument%2C_Edinburgh.jpg). It's that massive obelisk that has his statue on it. The thing is with Henry Dundas is that he didn't merely profit from slavery, he actively and supported it openly and worked tooth and nail to prevent it being abolished in the UK and the Empire. To repeat, he supported slavery and opposed abolition and was instrumental in keeping the practice legal. Historian Hugh Thomas in his book on Slavery stated that if it wasn't for Dundas, Slavery would've been abolished in the 1790s rather than 1833.

This man has a massive obelisk in his honour and two streets named after him: Dundas Street and Meville Street, and neither are minor Streets. One is a major road into the City Centre and the other is home to Consulates. Considering this man's fullhearted support of slavery and the current times, what should we do?

Personally, I think we could rename the streets in honour of someone more deserving, someone from Edinburgh, just as a start. I don't know if it would be considered erasing history for some, that has gone through my mind, but I don't think such a man should have two streets named after him.

And the Melville Monument? That for me is more complex. It's an a-listed monument, it dominates St Andrew's Square, and I don't think the Obelisk should be torn down like they did with the Statue of a Slaver in Bristol, it's too much of a part of the city to destroy. A professor at the University suggests a plaque bringing up his role in the slave trade, but what if we remove the statue and replace it with one of someone more deserving?

Does it change the past? No. Could it be considered erasing the past? Maybe, but I hope not. I would hope it would be a case of stripping a man who supported owning human beings of honours posthumously, as I don't think having a street, let alone two, named after him and a massive monument in his honour should be something a man like him should have. I think remove the statue, place it in storage for the historians and archeologists and find someone more deserving to look over George Street instead."

I have been living in a second floor flat for a few months now. Unfortunately for my downstairs neighbour, I'm a little prone to dropping things on my hardwood floor. It's not everyday and I think I'm a quiet neighbour most of the time, except for the clumsiness. I understand that obviously the occasional bang on the floor is irritating for my neighbour (the upstairs neighbours do it sometimes too but it doesn't bother me much), but everytime I drop something, she shouts up at me through the floor to shut up and she curses to herself. One time she even shouted at me for dropping earbuds on the floor. I know it can be a pain to hear noises from upstairs neighbours but is it really necessary to shout at me? 


What can I do about this situation? Would I be justified in asking her to stop shouting at me with a message left at her door?  Thank you for any advice!"

I hold it in my head as the perfect pub.

 It was underground and cosy, with soft leather seats and sofas. It was reasonably quiet, but busy enough later in the evening with occasional live music on the odd friday or saturday, when you wanted it to be. It was big enough that even on the quieter days you could always get a seat, but it also never felt dead in side.

There was a pool table so you could pop in for a game, and it was free occasionally which was a nice touch. Even with all the niceness of it all it still managed to be reasonably priced. Obviously pints in Aberdeen were cheaper, but it was still in the lower end. 

Does such a pub exist in the centre of edinburgh? I've been really missing a perfect cosy pub."

heg9j5,For people who have lived in Edinburgh a while: Have you noticed recent degradation of the city in last 2 years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/heg9j5/for_people_who_have_lived_in_edinburgh_a_while/,Causality,4,2020-06-24 00:37:10,82,/r/Edinburgh/comments/heg9j5/for_people_who_have_lived_in_edinburgh_a_while/,NA,"I was amazed by the charm and character of Edinbugh when I first visited years ago, I feel that is under real threat now. I think since around 2017, things have rapidly deterioted in many ways. I don't think the historic beauty of the city is being respected.  It's happened very quickly. I think the numbers of tourists and students in the city seems to have more than doubled (tripled?) in this time aswell. I remember as recently as 2015/6 you could walk around many areas of the town centre and it would be quiet, especially in the Autumn/winter months, now its mayhem. I used to walk around Holyrood park &amp;arthurs seat, and there'd be barely anyone there, now all year long, theres hoards of tourists up there. And I know I'm not imagining it because there are now trampled permanent grooves in parks from footfall, that weren't there before. Which says a lot about how much footfall has increased compared to history.

Also there is now several tour bus companies that run up and down Royal Mile, instead of just one. Why? It's a tiny street. Also huge amount of building and new construction work is just endless around the city, that never used to happen that I truly feeel now is threatening the city's amazing charm .

With all this increased activity I think other things are just not being kept up with around the city, small things but they add up. Cleanliness, pot holes, bin collection has become dire in many places. In historic parts of old town the cobbles are now an ugly hodge podge of evr increasing black tar fills, again due to increase in HGV traffic in old town area, wrecking the streets. I could go on. 

I'm not sure how much of this new income is going to locals and independant retailers. I think most is going to the big chain hotels, Airbnb landlords (which are also usually just companies buying up flats), and big event companies, and chain restaruants. I think one man owns 20+ businesses on the Royal Mile. So while its great more people get to experience edinburgh, I'm strugglign to see how the city is benefitting. I don't see this money going into communities that are clearly deprived and in desperate need of facelifts, that are very near the centre."

How do other commuters go to doctor/midwife appointments? Can I register for a GP in Edinburgh even though I live in Fife? Thanks very much."

I’m wondering what your experience was like getting your deposit back. 

I’ve lived in my flat for 7 years (i’m only leaving due to the landlord selling and I wanted to jump ship before notice was given to me). 

I’ve never broke anything in the flat and all my inspections which have been every 3/4 months since I moved in have all been satisfactory. 

My concern is I know that letting agents are leeches, especially when it comes to deposits. Obviously in 7 years there has been fair wear and tear but i’m not sure they’ll take that into consideration. Alsooo the fact the flat is being sold which means no more tenants/money for them I’m thinking they might want to hold on to as much of the deposit as possible... 

I was planning on cleaning the flat myself as I don’t wanna fork out £200 for a cleaning company for Fineholm to then turn around and say they want to take money off for cleanliness. (The 2 companies they recommended had shocking reviews so if I did get a cleaner i’d source them myself).   

Has anyone successfully got their deposit back from them?

Thanks!"

My start point is Portobello for reference. (Obviously Arthur's seat would be great, but it's a little busy for me to feel comfortable gaining any speed with so many people around)

Context: I (32M) currently live in a 2 bed ground floor flat which was the first property I bought around 3 years ago. It's generally fine but there are a lot of things that ideally need replacing.

Pros:

* Relatively quiet safe suburban area
* 20 minute tram into city centre
* 2 bed w/ loads of storage
* Garden + Easy free parking

Cons:

* Upstairs flat has laminate with no underlay - can be quite noisy (old 1930's flat building)
* New owners upstairs are really nice but have 2 wee boys - generally quiet at night but can be quite noisy during the day (no criticism of the kids - they're just being kids, but still can sound like an earthquake).
* Kitchen is badly laid out and cheap / seen better days.
* Bathroom is equally worn and ideally could do with an overhaul
* Boiler is old - still works but hot water can take a while to come in + things like the first shower of the day is fine, but if you use the shower again a few hours after, it goes hot then cold then hot then cold etc.
* Ideally could do with re-plastering and re-carpeting the entire rest of the house.

Since first buying my income has gone up which gives me more options. I'm aware of the cost of moving + getting a higher mortgage than I am on now (currently £600 a month which I find to be very affordable) . In general the area I'm in is nice but I don't know if it's worth staying and sinking a lot of money into the place, but run the risk of being fed up with the noise from upstairs?

I've done some work to the house already (new windows + door,  painting, polyfillaing, re-sealing etc but I'm very much torn between selling up now and buying a nicer new place - somewhere that needs very little work done to it or staying put.

I'm, also torn with the idea of moving further out which is a lot cheaper. I can easily work from home and I think there's a good prospect that in the future I'll be able to only go into the office 1 or 2 days a week. Albeit - most of my socializing occurs in Leith / city centre so that's a factor too.

Any advice or thoughts grateful!

Sincerely - torn homeowner."

My question is, is there much to do for young people in Edinburgh?

I of course love being in sweet independent cafés and bars, good pubs and decent shops are a plus.

Hobbies include watching live music and comedy, snowboarding, riding horses and going to bars that play good rock/pop rock music.

Happy to provide more information, I just don't want to be stuck in a place with no young people about..

TIA!"

Just jumped back onto FB to see how far people have taken the business fucking over its staff and the Facebook page no longer exists. 

One thing to keep in mind though: 

This *could* all be bullshit, and the cafe is being dragged through the shutter because some people took a rumour and went bananas with it

What was everyone's favourite nights and venues? Mine were probably the likes of Pure, Sublime, Pillbox and Manga. Venues like Studio 24 and Wilkie House had some amazing atmospheres, I'm amazed I can remember any of it given how those nights went! LOL

Here's a list of venues and club nights that I can remember (please let me know if I've got some venues mixed up, my memory is little more hazy these days!):

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Venue** \- Pure, Tribal Funktion, Sativa, Joy, Solescience, Concept (Cerotonin), Obscene, Majestica, Pressure meets Bugged Out!, Phosphorescence, React, UFreak

&amp;#x200B;

* **Calton Studios/Studio 24** \- Dogma (Lost), E-ruptor, Camel Beats, UTI, Dr No's

&amp;#x200B;

* **Liquid Room** \- Taste, Low Gravity, Progression, IT/Colours (ran at Honeycomb too), 

&amp;#x200B;

* **La Belle Angele** \- Scratch, Manga, Jungle Magik, Nameless, Ultragroove, Do This Do that, Big Beat, Yip Yap   

&amp;#x200B;

* **Ego**  (Known as **Luna** before it shut its doors) - Joy, Vibe, Mon.o, Musika, Nuklear Puppy, Modern   Lovers, The Go-Go club, VEGAS! (wasn't this the one with swing music and folk dressed up wearing fake fruit in their hats and looking like they were from the 50s/60s?!), Radio Babylon 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Berlin** (also known as **The Lane, District** pretty sure it went under the guise of other names) 

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Honeycomb** (originally the The Vaults - modern day Hive!) - Access, Motherfunk, Behave, Audio Deluxe, Affiliate, breakitdown, Lift

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cabaret Voltaire** (former **Peppermint Lounge**, the original **Honeycomb**) - Split

&amp;#x200B;

* **Wilkie House** (reopened briefly as Faith, now Stamash) - Sublime, Luvely

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Bongo Club** (original on New Street) - Headspin, Messenger Sound System, Pogo Vogue

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Bongo Club** (Holyrood Road) 

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Bongo Club** (Cowgate - current location)

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Caves** \- Kapital, Substance, Karnival, Departure Lounge 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Sneaky Pete's** \- Stepback, Volume!

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Wee Red Bar**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Henry Cellar Bar -** Substance (original venue), Trouble

&amp;#x200B;

* **Club** **Mercado (**became **Massa** and **Electric Circus**) - Colours ran some nights here I'm told. Got the likes of Carl Cox and John Digweed to play here apparently! 

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Mash House** (formerly known as **Left Bank, The Dram House, The GRV, Green Room Venue, Octopus Diamond** and probably a load of other names I've forgotten!) - No Strings Attached, Jackhammer (these guys play at every venue I swear!)

&amp;#x200B;

* **The Third Room** (I don't think this lasted long, it was the bar known as a bar **Medina**, with the middle eastern vibes where you could smoke hookahs. Now **Boteco**) 

Also what what was everyone's favourite pre-bars?  I remember **Pivo** and **Q Bar** before going to The Venue. Before La Belle Angele, **The City Cafe**, **Bam Bu** and **The Living Room** (before it burned down along with the club) were the bars a lot of folks went to for a pre-bevvie before the main event kicked off.

Others I remember were **Poprocket**, **The Outhouse**, **Moo Bar** (Meadows bar) and **The Human Be-In**

There's a ton I more that are probably in the back of my mind that I've forgotten about just now. I'll edit my original post with long running clubs that I've forgotten about i.e. ran for at least a year."

I noticed a man yesterday on Clerk St walking along past Timpsons towards Tesco with a camera hanging around his neck, but he had his hand on it the whole time, keeping it pointing forward. It was obvious to me that he was recording, but trying not to be noticed. I watched him for thirty seconds and saw him stop and purposely turn towards a few folk before walking on. He didn't say a thing or hurt anyone, he just wandered on down the street. Looked to be in his 50s/60s. Slightly awkward and shifty look about him, but I think that about a lot of people. 
I thought about the few times I've tried (and failed) to do a time lapse of my walk to work on my phone and thought maybe he's no different. But then I thought that he may be up to no good in some way.

I hope everyone is well and coping alright as we ease out of lockdown.

My mother really wants to go to town (while maintaining a social distance and masks ect) to have a ganter round the shops. 
The problem is she suffers from bowel problems and needs access to a loo quite regularly. 

I know it may seem a silly problem to someone else  but it’s quite a worry for her. 
Are there any public toilets open? In the train station? In the shop such as m&amp;s and primark that have recently re opened?

My girlfriend and I currently live in Govanhill in the Southside of Glasgow but we’re planning on making the move to Edinburgh. I don’t know the different areas of Edinburgh very well and with the coronavirus situation it’s difficult to come check the different areas out. We’re both ‘arty’ I’m an illustrator and my girlfriends an artist / sculptor so if there’s any more creative  / multicultural areas with indie shops /cafes / bars like the Southside of Glasgow that’d be cool. We don’t have a lot of money and making the jump from Glasgow to Edinburgh rent is a little eye watering but we’re looking to rent somewhere for ideally under 700pcm. People have suggested leith saying that a bit more ‘glasgowy’. If anyone’s got any suggestions of areas you think would suit us (or cafes/shops etc for us to check out when we’re there ) they’d be much appreciated!

Thanks!

This is a followup to the [post I made about Muirhouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/hkke1f/muirhouse_area/). 

The view is that suggesting to my 20's daughter that she look for somewhere else to live for a few months other than Muirhouse may be the best course of action.

Now... The question comes up, is where would you suggest she look for a flat. Monthly rent, furnished, for 3-6 months. I'm guessing most flats around the universities are booked up. I'd like to get something large enough that family could come spend some time, so at least one bedroom with an area to have someone stay. 

Most of the airbnb prices are around 1000-1500/month, but that may be the only option, plus I'm confused on this new order about not allowing airbnb to operate with shared entrance. There are still a ton of flats available on the site, with no mention of the rule. 

Suggestions or ideas?"

## From a wander in the capital a couple of weeks back, Saint Stephen's was designed by William Playfair and opened for worship in December 1828. Reconstruction was carried out in 1956-1957 by installing a floor across at the gallery level to create halls below and a church above. St Stephens was sold by the Church of Scotland in 2014 and it is now privately owned.

&amp;#x200B;

Future plans are to create 'A Dance House for Scotland' and a world class theatre in the round. It is now owned by the former head of the English National Ballet, who intends to convert it into a world-class dance school and venue.

&amp;#x200B;

In May stories were circulating that some of the pews had been removed from the building, this is against planning laws, the building is grade A-listed and any work inside or out must be done with consent of the city planners and I would think Historic Scotland and The Cockburn Society would raise questions over this.

&amp;#x200B;

The City of Edinburgh Council confirmed that its planning enforcement team “will carry out an appropriate investigation” following the reports from members of the public.

&amp;#x200B;

I also notice the building's webpage is ""temporarily unavailable."""

hlvewb,Challenging neighbour's application to cut down healthy tree in communal garden?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/hlvewb/challenging_neighbours_application_to_cut_down/,savacentre-e,11,2020-07-06 07:45:51,18,/r/Edinburgh/comments/hlvewb/challenging_neighbours_application_to_cut_down/,NA,"I live in a tenement in a conservation area in Edinburgh, and by chance stumbled across an application for planning permission to remove a sycamore tree from the communal garden. There's nothing wrong with the tree - it's a healthy, tall and slim - but the application says it blocks light and simply ""residents happy for it to be removed"". Only the applicant is named. 

Any opposition has to be submitted by next week. I am fed up seeing the back green become less biodiverse in the 6 years I've lived there - one neighbour hacked down most of an elder last week, another neighbour has replaced their grass with astroturf - but not sure how to challenge to application. I should mention that I don't live at the address of the tree, just nearby and looking onto it.

Here are the relevant things the council say you can comment on:

&gt;appearance of the area  
&gt;  
&gt;impact on a conservation area  
&gt;  
&gt;loss of significant landscape features  
&gt;  
&gt;loss of sunlight or daylight  
&gt;  
&gt;overshadowing  
&gt;  
&gt;privacy.

But they cannot consider comments on non relevant planning issues, such as

&gt;loss of private view

Maybe r/Edinburgh agrees or disagrees - that's fine - but does anyone have advice or examples on what can be done to save the tree, or at replace it? Ta!"

During lockdown they were doing virtual check outs over WhatsApp and the tenant would show them the items etc then a few days later they would inspect the property to make sure all is ok. 

I’ve just found out they are no longer doing virtual check outs and instead someone from the agency will come 3 days after i’ve handed my keys back to do the final check out. 

I requested a virtual call either on the day I move out or the day they visit and they have point blank refused. They won’t let me be present at all in any form. 

I don’t trust letting agents and to not be allowed to be present during a final check out seems extremely dodgy. 

Of course when I leave i’m going to take photos of everything/how clean it is and I also have a copy of my inventory and photos/a video of when I first moved in. 

One of my main issues is that there’s a few things that aren’t on the inventory that should be (like old items that i’ve had permission to be thrown out that are still on there). I queried this with my maintenance manager and she told me the inventory cannot be updated now but she has all emails so not to worry. I just can’t be assed with my deposit being delayed because I have to provide evidence/proof of stuff being here before I moved in and emails showing permission of items being thrown out. 

I just wanna know really if doing final check outs without allowing tenants to be present in any form is legal?"

The absence of much better to do during lockdown encouraged me to finally learn to cycle having never done it as a kid.

So, a couple questions for any experienced cyclists among you: 

\- Up to now I've mostly been using the Roseburn to Leith cycle path, and the paths around a couple of adjacent parks, so it's all been fairly flat and open. I'd like to start mixing up routes a bit and getting used to hills. Any tips on good routes I can start to try? Ideally nowhere too busy and definitely clear of motor traffic for now. 

\- As implied above, I've never owned a bike before. I don't really have a clue what to look for when buying or what sort of bike is best suited to Edinburgh. While I like the look of 'city bike' style models with sleek classic frames, I'm guessing they're better suited to Amsterdam or Berlin and that I won't be glad of one around, say, Corstorphine? I also don't want some sporty model with clip in pedals or anything like that, just a fairly basic first bike to save me having to walk between Just Eat stations. 

\- Are there any good online resources for learning about basic stuff like bike safety, maintenance etc? You'd be amazed how much of the stuff people think of as just being common sense, definitely is not if you never had a bike as a kid."

**I'm currently writing some poems to be submitted to a Leith // Edinburgh based anthology. The poems are about heroin and heroin addiction as written from my own experience. However, I have no experience with Leith or Edinburgh itself as I've never been!** 

**I was just wondering: Where would the 'rougher' parts of the district be today? The parts of the city that one might expect to find pushers, junkies, 'Trainspotting' types?**

Have seen *Trainspotting* a number of times, and read the book, but we've come a long way from the 90s so am unsure how accurate that still is today. The poems would probably be mostly focused on that era, but - on the chance I bring things forward a bit - it would be cool to have some references to explore, as taken from people far more in the know.

**I apologise if this in bad taste and mean no offence to what, I know, is an incredibly beautiful city I'm excited to visit hopefully one day, some day.** 

**Am also aware this might look like a ""WHERE CAN I GET DRUGZ IN YOUR CITY!?"" post. Rest assured it's not (us junkies are - no doubt unsurprisingly - quite efficient when it comes to sniffing out such things in-person)**

It would mean a lot if my work were to be published, so I'd love to make it as accurate as possible (and avoid slandering the current area).

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  &lt;3 x"

I like a drink as much as the next person and fully understand the need for businesses to make money. That aside, there are three bars on my street, all which seem to be handing out limitless drinks to people who really don't give a shit. People who are not social distancing and are happy to use property entrances to sit/lay or piss.

I understand the need for people to have a good time and let off some confinement steam, but living in the middle of it is a joke. And as I say, understand the need for businesses to make money to stay open but they do need to take some responsibility.

I was wondering how it's going in areas of Edinburgh and if you feel that we should take the Glasgow route of banning take away until the pubs open fully again?"

I've been working the door extensively over the last 6 weeks and I expected roughly 2/3rds of customers would have them but to my surprise it was more like 95% and the few customers that did not have were willing to get one from customer service (people with medical conditions were exempted from wearing a mask).

You could definitely see the ones not wearing masks looking sheepish as other customers glared at them.

Overall only a handful of special snowflakes in the store."

Like the COWARDs they are, they only do this when the streets are empty or there are few people around. My question is why do they get a free pass to engage in this intimidation, are they some sort of protected species like the seagulls?

## I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. I work mainly on postcolonialism and on gender. In light of racist attacks towards Asians due to Covid-19 (which is a piss poor but convenient excuse for racists), I am drafting an email to my MP to raise this issue in parliament. One of the key issues I want to raise is the difficulties in making reports due to lack of confidence in the police and also, I would imagine, difficulties in prosecuting perpetrators due to the lack of evidence perhaps. Regardless, if it is alright, I would love to speak to people who have had such unfortunate experiences and have made police reports (or not) to further substantiate my letter. At the same time, these are thoughts based on a few stories I have heard, but I am also aware that there are certainly a lot more issues and problems that people who have had this unfortunate experience encounter. 

## Hopefully this letter, once drafted and my claims about police substantiated, can be circulated and our MPs and MSPs can be pestered in concrete political action.Please feel free to DM me for more information and I will be happy to collaborate with anyone on this. This is something that affects communities at large and is not some 'personal' project of mine. Thank you for your time!"

However when May came around they changed their mind and and refused to end the tenancy. This has essentially trapped me into a lease that I no longer want to be part of. Our friendship has entirely broken down at this point.  The flat is a very inhospitable place. The friends that they choose to keep as well as the drug use in the flat has made me very uncomfortable to stay there. I am now living in a new flat. My friend is now ignoring my messages and as a result I am left paying for a flat that I no longer even have keys to.

I have been in contact with shelter Scotland but they have been entirely unhelpful. They say that we just need to work it out together despite the fact that I am now actually quite scared of my housemate and her antisocial friends. 

The landlord has a similar attitude in that he does not want to get involved between our dispute and is restricted slightly with tenancy laws. However I have presented him with grounds for eviction of which he does not seem to want to pursue.

Looking for recommended areas to buy a house.

I've seen a few posts recommending areas to move to for people new to Edinburgh but they're largely based on people wanting to rent, I'd like to buy somewhere. Budget might be able to stretch up to £350k but ideally more around 300. 

**Long version**

I'm currently separating from my wife, we'll be looking to sell our hosue and go our own ways. Not a great time, but an opportunity for a fresh start in a new city (I currently like in Sheffield) and I like Scotland, I like Edinburgh (I've not lived there but as a visitor), and I've been approached about some work in Edinburgh. I have some friends that recently moved to St Andrews too, so I'd be closer to them.

Obviously only me now so I don't need somehwere huge, would like a reasonably nice area though. Ideally within maybe 5 miles of the city centre, so I can cycle in, but open to somewhere with a decent train commute. I enjoy walking/running in parks/woodland and out in the countryside, so access to those a benefit.

I'd be new to living in the city too, so any other advice or anyone that's had a similar move wanting to share would be cool."

The compliance on public transport wasn't very good even immediately after they were mandated on buses. Last week when they were required in stores I noticed a massive uptake both at work and on public transport, but it seems people have gotten tired of it.

I've been on buses with twenty people on them and I've been one of a small few wearing a mask. I've seen people letting the mask drop below their noses, including my colleagues. At my work we were advised by the police not to enforce the rule for customers, and we've had people coming into the shop, and taking ninety minutes to pick a couple of items. We aren't requiring employees who work behind perspex screens to wear masks, even though the perspex screens aren't actually between the customer and the employee, and the customer is definitely less than two metres away; for some reason this IS legal. People get on buses and then proceed to take their masks off - I saw one lady get off a bus and then put on her mask which absolutely boggled my mind.

If you're not properly wearing a mask you aren't protecting yourself or the people around you, and you're breaking the law. It's all very well laughing at England because they're complaining about the introduction of a measure we only introduced last week, and promptly decided to ignore, but it won't be as funny if we have to go into a second lockdown.

Either police need to start actually enforcing the law with heavy fines, or shops and buses need to be given support when they enforce it."

What Should I Know?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/hu4ml4/moving_to_edinburgh_in_september_yay_what_should/,File-Own,0,2020-07-20 03:19:19,73,/r/Edinburgh/comments/hu4ml4/moving_to_edinburgh_in_september_yay_what_should/,NA,"I'm a professional currently living in Northern England (originally from the Midlands), and am going to be moving to Edinburgh at the start of September. I've already read the FAQ/post on here and numerous blogs but thought I'd ask Reddit for some personal tips :)

**If you could please answer any of the questions below I would be super grateful &lt;3**

\-My budget is 400 to 700 a month based on what I've seen on Spare Room, Gumtree etc. I earn a decent amount but like to save. I don't mind sharing but is there any way I could get a studio in a decent area (or one where I can easily walk to Princes Street, etc.) for that kind of price?

\-I'm aware Scotland is currently a lot more strict on COVID than England (though soon we'll have to wear masks in shops too). Has this made Edinburgh more deserted - would it be harder to do normal things like view places (I would much rather view in person than on Zoom, certainly wouldn't sign without doing that first), go out shopping for clothes/food, etc.? Is there anything else I should know? Don't wanna get fined haha

\-What's the weather going to be like in September? (I'm literally travelling over on the 1st). I'm bringing a winter coat but will I be OK in a T-shirt/jeans at the start? Idk what to bring/throw away clothes wise. Besides my masks :P

\-Are touristy places like Princes Street, Waverly Mall etc. still open/busy? I'm wondering what the atmosphere will be like compared to when I previously visited around Burns Night in Jan. Does it have a ""deserted"" kind of feel now?

\-I'm planning on staying till February, so maybe even just renting for a couple of months at the outset to try the place out. That said, I want to stay all through autumn. **What are some autumn ""must dos"" in Edinburgh/Scotland? (besides Hogmanay/the Xmas Market ofc)? Where should I go to see the foliage, beautiful countryside etc.?**

\-I have a pretty strong Home Counties accent and casually had the piss taken out of me for ""sounding English"" and like a ""posh girl"" multiple times in Scotland before (in a friendly way haha). That said, would I be best off toning it down it in less touristy parts if possible?

\-Last but not least... what's the dating scene like in Scotland/what are Scottish men like? (Yeah, I know it depends on the person lmao - but a lot of the ones I've known seem a bit more down to earth/laid back as well as traditionally masculine. In b4 rustled jimmies aha.)

Thank you guys in advance! Can't wait to move to this gorgeous country \^\_\^"

I know lots of places and tourist attractions are still closed, but does anyone know about a place called Department of Magic?

So now I'm trying to message, email, call them and haven't heard back. I know they might just be busy and not responding, but their social media hasn't updated since March, and thinking about it, the email didn't mention corona virus protections, which almost every other thing we've booked since lockdowns have eased has had jargon about distancing and sanitizer etc.

So... Can anyone tell me if this place is open? I know a lot of bars are, just not sure about this. I'm taking 2 little kids that love Harry Potter, I really don't want to tell them I've got a cool surprise for them only to find a shut down bar.

My only concern is the midges. I've not camped in this part of Scotland before, and I know that it's best to avoid water sources. Should I find somewhere else, or camp a bit further away from the water?

We have a place sorted and have taken the lease from the 1st of August but we won't be moving until around the 28th. It was a bargain, beautiful and big enough for under a grand, we didn't think we would do any better so we agreed to take it for the 1st of August.

The problem is trying to sort out a British bank account. We are trying to set up an account with Octopus energy but they have made it clear we need a UK bank account and won't accept a bank transfer from either an Irish or German account for payment. Unfortunately, I have spent the last few days trying to open a British account to no avail, having tried Halifax, HSBC, Starling, Lloyds and several others - we need a UK address for the card to be sent to or a UK phone number.

Our landlord is due to take a meter reading for us at the end of this month, seems like a nice fella but we cannot seem to get over this hurdle. Seems like this will be the case regardless of the energy supplier, has anyone ever encountered this type of issue before? Once we are in Scotland, we will both open accounts straight away but at the moment, we don't quite know what to do next and of course, COVID isn't making things any easier. I am looking into TransferWise but I'm not sure if it will be of much help. Thanks."

I'll be moving to Edinburgh in September(ish) time, but will only have maybe 2/3 chances to go have a good look around before moving. With that in mind I was wondering if there are any places I should just avoid looking at living. I know pretty much every city has rough patches, but I'd rather not live anywhere that will cause me a lot of trouble. 

There are a lot of places in Restalrig, Heriot Hill, Polwarth and Mayfield - do any of those scream ""I would not live there"" to you?

Cheers!"

This means that anyone, from anywhere can just take part in a weekend filled with fun and games, online from the comfort of their own home and its also all free.

Over the course of the weekend we are planning on running some crossplatform games, so it doesn't mean you can't play if you don't have a PC! There's some tournaments planned as well, such as: CSGO, Rocket League and Halo 3. We also have some Jackbox thrown in for the Friday night! 

We have a full list of games and a timetable/schedule on our Discord server, you can react to the event signup and be added to a role along with reacting to the games list so you get a ping 30 minutes prior to it starting.

It's my wife's 40th at the start of next month and basically COVID has screwed up the plans I'd made.  


We were supposed to be going to Greece with a group of friends but that got cancelled. We had a really nice long weekend in Edinburgh last year (my first ever visit) so decided to come back up for a few days instead.   


I'm trying to find a ""memorable"" restaurant for the evening of the 8th (her birthday) but as we have an 8 year old with a limited palette with us and there's still the closures due to the virus I'm struggling to find somewhere. Anything too ""fancy"" would be a nightmare with someone who can't even tolerate spaghetti hoops touching her chips, a foam or spherification would blow her noggin :)  


So I thought what better than to ask the locals for help :)  


I had looked at The Scran &amp; Scallie but they don't seem to have availability on the 8th but something like that or a nice Italian would be good or something more Scottish / British / Gastro pub. I had thought about trying to find a Greek given we're missing the holiday but maybe that's daft.   


I don't want to put money into chain places, I'd rather go with a local hero / favourite if I can.   


We're staying close to Waverley Train Station so ideally something walkable from there would be great, we'll have the car with us but I'd rather just park it when we arrive and leave it (despite the £1938473623 cost of doing so at Waverley Station, who knew!).  


Also open to any suggestions of ""must see"" things that aren't obvious, we did the Castle, Royal Yacht &amp; Camera Obscura, last time but I keep seeing lovely pictures of Dean Village and was thinking a walk there might be worthwhile?   


Also looking for suggestions of somewhere nice to get a slice of cake / cupcake on the day in lieu of a full blown cake and candles that will go to waste and any other input you lovely folk might have for a visitor coming up at the moment.   


It's all a bit daunting, I just want to make sure she had a nice time and make the best of things.   


Thanks in advance for any help you can provide."

**Drop off**

*  Where's the best spot to drop someone off, for free? *I saw signs to a free drop off area near the LongStay car park, but it looks like this would require a shuttle bus -* ***how long does the usually take from drop off at the car park to arrival at the terminal?*** *The website claims it 'runs frequently and only takes around 5 mins', but a friend of mine actually missed a flight before due to a shuttle bus waiting until it was full to leave, so I don't have much faith in them unless you're arriving definitively early...In the end I paid £2 to drive through Charged Drop Off zone in the multi-storey car park.*

**Pick up**

*  Where's the best location to pick someone up, for free? I'm talking about someone walking over and jumping in the car, not a 'meet-and-greet' scenario. *There were no signposts for a 'free pickup area'', but according to the website it's the Long Stay car park which is free for 0-30 mins. As above h****ow long does it usually take from arriving at the terminal to arriving at the long stay pick up?*** *In the end I picked up at the* ***Hampton by Hilton****, but it was a 10pm pickup during COVID, so the airport wasn't exactly busy. I think I did see one car getting 'moved along' by a police car though.*

I’ll be relocating to Edinburgh from Canada soon and had some questions regarding expenses and neighbourhoods.

I’ll be staying at the company provided temp residence for a while so I was hoping to gather as much info as possible before the move.

- we’re a family of four, with two kindergarteners looking to find a quiet, family oriented neighbourhoods. I was looking at detached homes near Burdiehouse, Danderhall and Gilmerton but it seems like they’re relatively a new outskirts town since google maps were showing a completely barren or in-construction lands. Would anyone know if those neighbourhoods are okay?

- which is the best cellular service provider? We were hoping to land at Glasgow and attain the service before travelling to Edinburgh.

- Which banks would you recommend? I’ve seen the HSBC had an international account, which I could theoretically access my Canadian accounts from Edinburgh if I could.

- what are some of the surprising expenses for expats myself need to be mindful of? Other than getting to spend too money on the whiskey... :)

Partner and I are planning to elope (sort of - sign a civil partnership in our home town and then immediately hop on the train for our ""elopement"") to Edinburgh, plague permitting, which is very exciting. Current vague plan is September 2021. Neither of us have ever been though, so I have questions!

We'd like to stay in the city so that we're near restaurants, theatres, museums, etc, we're going to stay for a few days so we can really make a citybreak weekend of it. What area would be good to stay in? We've been looking at Airbnb and there's lots of nice places in Leith, West End, a few other spots. I think Edinburgh is bigger than where we live at the moment so it's hard to gauge how spread out things are. What would anyone advise about this? 

We also want to go out for a very fancy dinner on the evening of the actual ""official"" day. I've been looking at a few places on the internet. I know by this time next year some may well have closed or new ones opened but hypothetically, where would you recommend for a seriously fancy elopement dinner? I will be buying a very swish dress, not a wedding dress but something in a similarly extravagant vein, and he'll be in something very distinguished, so we'll be well and truly dressed for dinner!

We're also going to find a nice little spot to sit and say some nice things and exchange a gift and have a nice picture taken. I have seen Dr Neil's Garden which looks lovely and the sort of thing we'd like but any other ideas of places to look at?

And finally we'll be spending a couple of days afterwards doing nice Edinburgh-y things together. Want to see a show, go out to the museum, go to the zoo, have some more nice meals both fancy and non-fancy,, etc etc. Any recommendations about these or of other things we should see and do while we're there? Again I know this is ages away still so everything is subject to change but we're just in ""fun planning"" mode. I'm also aware that if we want to book certain things we'll have to be doing it relatively sharpish, particularly accomodation, as a lot of people will also be booking things they hope to do post-plague (assuming things are a bit more ""normal"" by then) or rearranging things they've had to cancel this year due to covid.

I've been living in Edinburgh for almost two years now. I'm trying to get to know the city as much as possible, but there are two things which I totally cannot understand, so I thought that maybe you would help me.

1. Bike theft. Quick googling says that Edinburgh is second or third worst city in the whole UK when it comes to that. I come from eastern Europe, where problem is pretty big as well, yet here it seem to be much bigger! How come that council (or whoever) does not try to handle this? Police is not really enthusiastic about chasing that topic, while simple foot patrols would help, I think (not trying to be smartass here tho).
2. Housing market. Lots of tourists (and probably students, idk) makes living in the city centre more and more expensive. Half of each year it is impossible to find new flat if you want to move, because there's either Fringe, Hogmanay or whatever else. There are shitloads of airbnbs and other short lets. I know Edi is not the only city in Europe who has that kind of problems, yet some of the other cities managed to tackle the problem (like Berlin banning airbnb for some time altogether lol). Rent prices going up also means, that more and more people actually living in the city have to move further away from the centre, and while it is perfectly ok that some people prefer houses with backyards, some people like to be in the city itself. Why nobody is trying to make lives of Edinburghers a little bit better?

Sorry if those sound stupid or obvious, but just cannot find answers anywhere"

They are clearly taking advantage of the pandemic and recession to pay either the absolute bare minimum or if the person is over 25, considerably less than the minimum wage.

My stair in the Old Town had a flat used as an airbnb up until before the lockdown. The owner now has long term tenants in the property. I came back to our close today to find two new lockboxes attached to the outer gate. That's now a total of five. One attached to the masonry and four to the gate. I've written to the owner asking if the new ones are his. They can't be for my stair. Anyone know what my rights are? Can I have them cut off if they belong to someone who doesn't own a property in the stair? If they belong to the chap who owns the Airbnb can he attach as many as he likes? Seems a bit ridiculous if he can. I've contacted the council via Edinhelp on Twitter and will follow up depending on the direction I get but I'm interested to know if anyone else has been in the same position. I saw other postings related to this but they were mainly about lockboxes attached to public properties. My suspicion is that these new lockboxes are for entry to other flats in the area owned either by the flat owner in my stair or someone else. Either way not happy at all about it.

She pulled over at the earliest safe opportunity, as was legally required. This happened to be a bus stop (Dundas Street was already full with parked cars). She stopped at 9.30 am, and I came and collected our daughter at 10 am. 

While waiting for a recovery truck, at 11 am she crossed the road to the The New Town Fox cafe to use their toilet. The owners and multiple customers there had seen what had happened and she had already been offered food, drinks, shelter from the sun etc. As soon as she’d gone into the toilet, a parking attendant sprung up and started to ticket her car, despite the clearly shredded car tire. 

My fiancee returned as he was taking photos. She pointed out that she was only there because she couldn’t move her car (most bus drivers had checked she was OK rather than be mean to her). Had the parking attendant stated he was doing his job, we have no issue, and we can appeal the ticket.

However, he somewhat randomly started shouting at and berating my fiancee. Not only is my fiancee pregnant, but she is also one of the least confrontational people I know. She was attempting to explain the situation, and this guy lost it. Members of the public intervened, having witnessed this unprovoked and wildly inappropriate aggression towards a lone, pregnant female (while breaking social distancing and not wearing a mask). My fiancee was left in tears being consoled by members of the public. Witnesses came and gave her their contact details, genuinely surprised by the randomness of this aggression. 

Anyway, I wrote to Edinburgh Council a week ago and have yet to receive any response. This does not surprise me. A long time ago I was a publicist at one of the world’s most prestigious public affairs agencies. We worked closely with governments so I knew to bcc in several relevant people from the council as I was likely to receive an auto reply meaning they cannot deny not receiving my email. 

This is a very long shot, however, my fiancee believes someone got some / all of this on video. When she called me I genuinely thought she’d had a miscarriage given her degree of upset however, by the time I’d consoled her over the phone and told her to speak to the guy filming, he’d gone. I would love to get hold of this footage.

Shortly after this happened, I tweeted CEC asking to whom I should complain? Two journalists have since contacted me from those tweets however, we have no real interest in becoming a story for a news cycle. But, I’m not going to drop this with the council. There was no possible justification for this parking attendant's actions and behaviour, and we have witnesses. I figured r/Edinburgh seemed one of the most likely ways I might be able to get hold of this footage (even though I still know it’s a huge long shot). 

My fiancee and both grew up and have spent the majority of our lives in Edinburgh. Parking attendants are never anyone’s favourite people, and we could accept if he was just doing his job however, there is zero justification for abusing anyone so, if anyone has this footage, I’d be hugely grateful to receive it.

Cheers,

Jamie"

Im planning on studying at Edinburgh Napier University Im about 85% sure Im going there next spring for a semester but before I confirm I would love to know a little more about the school other than what I learned from the internet like the pros and the cons from the students themselves and don't leave out any bad ones since I am going to be living there for 6 months I want to be prepared for the worst. I am from California its pretty sunny most of the time. I'll prob be in Scotland from Jan to June how is the weather is it manageable with a coat does it rain a lot those 6 months. Hows the nightlife there? Is it safe/unsafe? Are there places to go where most students hang out? Are people at the school mostly friendly? Any places you recommend going? I am going to be talking 3-4 classes one language some GE requirements but how are the teachers there are they approachable, understanding, etc. I did some research when it comes to the location it seems like its a 15 min walk to the old town and im not sure if there is anything right near the housing and I will be staying at Bainfield. Is that the best housing to stay at. I was looking at the multiple campuses and do you guys know which one I would be taking classes at? What's the best way of transportation? Cost of living in Edinburgh? And anything else you think I should know :) and if anyone is willing to talk to me personally especially another study abroad student I would truly appreciate it.

 Leith Walk bar makes decision to close its doors, with staff in self-isolation, after customer informed them late on Friday evening that he tested positive for Covid-19.

An Edinburgh bar has been forced to shut its doors after a customer tested positive for coronavirus.


Anna Lagerqvist Christopherson, owner of the Victoria Bar on Leith Walk, told the Evening News the premises had to close after a punter informed them he had Covid-19.

According to Ms Christopherson, the customer had recently returned from a holiday in Malta – and it's thought he may have become infected there.

Victoria Bar on Leith Walk has been forced to close its doors after a customer tested positive for Covid-19.
Only a handful of customers were in the Victoria Bar at the same time as the infected customer, who isn’t believed to have visited any other bars or restaurants.

Ms Christopherson said: “I made the decision to close the bar.

“We found out at midnight last night that there had been someone with a case at the bar on Friday afternoon.

“The bar was quiet and the person had been to Malta, where it's suspected they contracted the virus.

""The customer had a mask on, so hopefully that will have helped prevent the spread.”

Ms Christopherson added that the customer was in Victoria Bar between 4:45pm and 6pm on Friday, and that he didn’t visit anywhere else.

“Now we have decided to self-isolate,” she continued. “There were only four people working on Friday.

""The person that was working when the customer was in the bar obviously needs to be tested now – but we’re also thinking we need to close until we get the results of that test.

""This kind of thing is going to keep on happening, for sure, so we just need to learn how to deal with it.”

Seeking for advice - Me and my wife, we are planning to move next year after I get my bachelors. I have a few questions, but at first little background. So, we are from Latvia and after searching for the best city which would suit us, we came to the conclusion that Edinburgh is the place where we want to move. 

1) After completing some internet based tests I found out that my English is upper -intermediate, would it be tough (or even possible) to find a job in legal field? (Legal assistant, aml/kyc etc.) Do companies hire guys like me? How strict the rules are? 

2) How much do I need to earn to live comfortably?

P.S. I have read internet articles already, but I did not find answers to these questions.

I want to move to Edinburgh and based on my research so far the areas like Liberton/Inch/Craigour/Moredun are quite affordable in terms of house renting, have quite a few parks/shops nearby and fairly good connection to the city center, i.e. below 30 mins by a bus.

Can someone who has recently lived there or currently lives there, share their opinion on how is it to live there? Are these really rougher areas as some people and SIMD suggest? Or is it actually alright and the positives I mentioned above are true?

I drove down this route all the time for years and there were never any traffic issues apart from a bit of jam down Duke Street past Tesco at peak hours. Yet now, they entire area system is f\*\*\*cked. It's hell.  You can spend easily 10 minutes just getting to where the roundabout is and theres queueus all the way up Lochend Road where never were before, the lights let 2 cars through at a time, but often no cars get through because of the congestion from other lights. 

The kicker is that all these delays to traffic was actually **intended** by the city planners. The incredibly short lights deliberatly delay traffic moving into Duke Street toward Leith Walk to stop more chaos arising due to the tram line works. They also tried to throw in something about making it more pedestrian friendly, but how is it now friendlier to pedestrians when the entire place is now so horribly congested with fuming lorrries, cars, and buses? It's horrible to walk around this road now.

It seems like the city is willing to do anything to disrupt and lower the quality of life of its permanent citizens to acheive its goal of getting tourists to and from the airport as quickly as possible. There is a heartless neoliberal money-matters attitude to Ed developments, as if they only way forward is the maximisation of all potential profits asap to be a truly global success city. The council is going down the wrong route, the philosphy is all wrong. tourists don't come to Ed for the tram. The city is a historical charm and should be protected, there seems to be no limit on the development desires of the people in charge.

These huge congestions now **increase** pollution for all who walk and live around here, with all the cars and HGVS sat with their engines running, and pulling off. But, hey, the tram needs a direct route to the Royal yacht I guess.

This morning as I'm out for a run, I come past the guy who sits outside the Scotmid in Marchmont.  I can see him with head down and he's got a big bundle of £10 notes and he's counting them.  There's well over £100 from what I see.  I challenge him about this and he hides the money, denies it and then starts speaking in his native tongue, probably in disgust at me catching him.

I've spoken to Scottish homeless people and they have told me these are gangs and some have been shifted off their turf by this group.  They come to the nice areas of Edinburgh because people give them money.  These same people seem to be very naive and don't see if for what it is.  If you are one of these people giving them money, please stop.  You are funding organised crime.  The gangs that run all these ""homeless"" crews will not be nice people and will be involved in many other criminal enterprises.

I'm a researcher working on a project focused on the history of different areas of Edinburgh - one of them being Pilton. For the past few weeks, I've been scrolling through the online newspaper archives from the year 1800 for any mention of Pilton and I've worked my way up to the 1980s. One article made mention of a three part documentary, called 'Heroin', that was produced by Granada TV and broadcast in 1983 when heroin was being made into a national issue. It followed the group SHADA and the difficulties they faced in tackling and preventing drug use in the area. It would be extremely valuable to my research, of which the goal is to examine the social history of Pilton and to discuss the ways that (political, cultural, medical) authorities have understood the people living there and how bias and discrimination have contributed to a particularly negative image of the area.

Unfortunately there is no record of it on the Scottish Moving Image Archive and the Pilton Video Archive is not open for business right now with the virus. Does anybody happen to have a copy of this documentary or could point me in the direction of an online source? I would also be very glad to find out if there are any similar documentaries or other films which focus on Pilton or on Edinburgh's social problems in the past.

Soo I had my fair share of shitty neighbours but these ones take the cake.. I'm writing here in the hopes that somebody comes out with an easy solution that is not moving out, cause I have just moved in.

Me and my girlfriend just moved in this second floor flat and immediately got a dog (approved by the landlord). There's also a communal garden in the back so it's perfect! Well one of the neighbours of the ground floor have another dog as well, a big German shepherd, and they use the garden to let the dog poop and pee (like us). We usually check if they're there already before coming in with our dog, so to avoid potential issues (I don't know how my dog behaves with other dogs yet, and I don't know theirs either. They keep it off the leash when there). 

The first couple of days all was fine apart from some cold glares from the mom (I think it's just a mom with his big boy living there) and absolutely no ""good morning"" or politeness of sort (not that I care). Well the other day we noticed that somebody locked the door to the communal garden, and we don't have the key. We contact our landlord and he says he probably never needed a key for that door, but he will let us know.. Whatever. Anyway, tonight I was in the garden with my brand new retired greyhound and I hear somebody messing with the lock. At the moment I honestly thought for a moment somebody locked the door, but I ignored that idea thinking it was too fool. Well after my boy did his business I found out the door was actually locked, so I knocked loudly. Somebody came to finally open it after a while, seemingly having problems opening it, accusing me of having broken the lock? Then when he (the son) managed to do it I lashed out a bit at him, asking him why the fuck would you lock the door without even seeing if there's somebody in there. He got incredibly  mad somehow, and we had a heated argument, which can be summarised as follows:

1. He's angry that I shouted at him, even if he came to rescue me (good lord) 
2. He locks the door because he has the key so it's our fault for not having the key
3. He locks it because he's afraid of break-ins
4. I try to calm down, I apologise for the shouting and tell him he can lock the door whenever he wants, just please look outside first to see if somebody's there
5. He refuses. He says he'll lock the door and doesn't care
6. Ah yeah also since we came here we disrupted the peace of the place because THEIR dog barks now when our dog walks the stairs

I really tried guys, I swallowed all my pride during this escalation in order to keep it civil because I hate fighting (even verbal) and I want to be relaxed when I come home. But after he answered me ""I will find a way"" when I asked him ""what if I lock you outside? You wouldn't like it right?"", I knew with this guy was impossible to reason. Also, he doesn't looks stable nor the mother. So I told him goodnight and I went to bed. But I'm very afraid for my girlfriend and my dog. I wrote to my landlord who will have a chat with them but suggested calling the police, because he has no power in this. But I'm honestly afraid of retaliations, as I don't know these people, and I'm a foreigner.

This sucks big time. What should I do?

This post is very maths heavy.

My spouse has an interview coming up for a job in Edinburgh, so I'm going to start looking for work soon. I'm asking here for some advice on what sorts of jobs I may be qualified for either now or with a bit more prep, anywhere in the Central Belt honestly. I'm just so intimidated by industry and changing my career in my forties. Here's my background.

I've been a teaching/research mathematician at a small US university (teaching focused) for awhile. I have tenure, publish just over paper a year in mid-tier journals, and teach a few classes/semester; primarily Calculus to science majors and pre-meds, though I also teach very small classes across the major. My PhD is in Graph Theory and I spend most of my research time working on theoretical problems. Though I've taken the required graduate courses in Algebra, Analysis, and Topology, I haven't thought much about them in awhile. I have a basic undergraduate's working understanding of Stats, and have taken Andrew Ng's Coursera course on ML. I don't think I'm qualified to teach at a UK university, nor do I want to advise PhD theses or work 80 hour weeks to publish papers with high REF scores.

I've spent a lot of time teaching myself the basics of Data Science (or at least what most people call DS these days). I am relatively competent in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and the modules NumPy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Networkx, and Scikit-Learn, though I have a lot left to learn. I did a single Data Science consulting job for which I learned a lot of these packages. It was pretty stressful to work on my own with no real direction and a client that didn't know much about what they wanted.

I don't ever expect to become a Software Engineer. I would love to find something combining my mathematics background with a modest amount of scripting, ideally with others and ideally involving some training on the job. But I really don't know exactly what to look for on the job boards. I'm not asking for sites like indeed.co.uk, but for what career titles and language to be looking for.

Please, if you're able, give me an idea of what the day-to-day or project-to-project is like. Is it writing code all day alone in an office? Half time working from home on optimizing algorithms and half time with a team? Literally just copy-pasting from StackExchange for 40 hrs/week?"

The home report gave the roof a 2 but and saying that the owner has to expect repairs given the age of the property. Also, the surveyor was not able to view the roof and made a best guess on the state of it, we called him and confirmed this. When we asked the agent/sellers we were told that no major repairs are expected.  This all is making us pretty concerned about the roof and we are planning to chat with all the neighbors tonight to get to know them and check what has been done on the roof over the last years. The property is selling for 205K fixed price in Fountanbridge which is reasonable but if there is a 20K bill waiting for us it would change the whole picture."

I have been living in a share flat for a couple of years, the only 'contract' I ever signed was with one of the other tenants agreeing to pay a monthly amount that included my share of the rent and bills, no bills were ever in my name and I never signed anything with the landlord. 

Me and a second flat mate moved out earlier this year as the third flatmate turned out to be a bit of a nutter. The third flatmate has continued living there since and has been fighting eviction. I paid everything I thought I was due when I moved out and thought I was rid of the drama, but now almost 3 months later Ive gotten a energy bill in the mail in my name but with my old address, dated for the period covering my last three months in that flat. I didn't realise it was possible for someone to change the name on a bill account to someone who isnt even living there and Ive already paid what I owed! I will call the company tomorrow and tell them it aint my bill to pay, but Im worried they might tell me since I lived there during that period its my problem to sort out? I don't want to have to be in a positon where I have to get the money out of my old flatmate as he is a nutter and is probably completely broke. Incidently the bill is also enormous, far more than the three of us were normally paying across three months, so I don't know where the amount came from.

If you or anyone you know is currently seeking work in Edinburgh PLEASE READ, because you may be walking in to some bad business.

Unfortunately I wont/can't be naming WHO the people are, as they have been previously named on this subreddit and the post itself was suspiciously blocked from being viewed by anyone in the UK for reasons along the lines of defamation having a detrimental affect on their recruiting. If anything my post should just serve to make people more cautious about who they're applying to, and maybe they'll be able to suss out who I'm talking about. By not naming the company but instead describing my negative experience with *a* company... I'm sure you get the idea.

I applied for a job the other day and went through an interview with a company, the job in question was for marketing and had a ""competitive"" but commission based salary. They got back to me within 24 hours of my application and were asking for an interview the very next day, the interview was also to be with the CEO himself. If you've ever been on the unemployment fandango then you'll probably know yourself this is usually too good to be true. First major red flag. The second biggest red flag was that I still had no idea what the fuck this job was actually about beyond ""marketing"".

During the interview, they had explained to me that they were a ""rapidly growing business"" who were hiring to fill their new offices as they'd just opened a 2nd one in Edinburgh, which meant that they were seeking to employ and train and didn't want to hire people based on previous experience. They also mentioned that they had been growing rapidly because of unemployment due to Covid-19.

Another thing worth noting is that before the interview, they ask you to read several articles from www.edinburghlive.co.uk, as well as to check out their website. The articles in question are all about the CEO and about how great and intelligent he is, and about how great it is to work for him and how everyone who works at his company is just constantly climbing ladders and earning more money, and every few paragraphs has group photos of very happy people in suits practically saying ""THIS COULD BE YOU!"". The website isn't much different except one of the photos is of some super expensive tropical paradise compay holiday or something.

After the interview, they tell me that they'll email me in 2 hours whether or not I was successful to book me an appointment for a SECOND interview tomorrow morning. Since I'm suspicious I look them up on Glassdoor.co.uk to see if I can dig anything up.

The reviews are massively favorable, but polarizing. 5 star reviews from current employees all along the lines of ""AMAZING PLACE TO WORK, SO FRIENDLY"". 1 star reviews from former employees all screaming ""THIS IS A SCAM AND A PYRAMID SCHEME! DO NOT FALL FOR IT!""

I dug further and found a Google result from this very subreddit by another user saying ""BE WARNED - COMPANY NAME"" - except if you're in the UK you can't read it because it's blocked in the UK in response to a ""legal request"". Regardless, it's not very hard to get around these sorts of things, so here's some comments to read for yourself regarding the subject.

https://imgur.com/a/GiEvEbs

So from this, I learned that the job was not actually marketing but was just street peddling whatever product they had told you to peddle for that day. If you see any young folks at supermarkets trying to sell you electric suppliers, they've probably fallen for this exact company's scam.

They have created what is essentially a grooming interview process to make you think from the start that you've MADE IT, you're in the big business now. Life is going to be perfect because this great ""family"" company has descended upon you like an angel to present to you the business opportunity of a lifetime. They will promise you everything to get you making money for them.

It's worth noting in the second image which had a link, it leads to the Glasgow subreddit about the company which ISN'T blocked because the mods of that subreddit didn't allow it I imagine. In fact they went as far as to publish the report from the company itself to show just how hard they're trying to hide/censor the fact that they're a scam. If you can find it, it's worth a read.

While I was successful in my interview, I think that's only because they thought I was the gullible sort who wouldn't fall in to their scheme (or bother to read up reviews on Glassdoor). Don't think I'll be going to second the interview.

Regardless, please think about who you're applying to work for. While times may seem hard and you feel desperate for any work... there are people out there who would prey on the unemployed and otherwise lacking in wisdom/experience, even going as far as to abuse mass unemployment as a result of a global pandemic, while simultaneously using censorship tactics online to make sure that their shady business doesn't get the spotlight put on it.

Be safe, be smart, and always learn about who you're going to try and work for."

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I are planning on moving up to Edinburgh from London late this year / very early next year and we were just hoping for a few opinions. I work in Tech but due to COVID-19, my job is now 100% remote and will be forever, which means I can bring my job with me which makes things a little easier.  


My girlfriend works in hospitality here in London, but unfortunately found out yesterday that after the furlough scheme is finished, she'll most likely be made redundant. We were waiting on news from her job before we made a decision, but I think this has finalised it and we've decided that Edinburgh is the best place to be.  


We've visited plenty of times as my family is originally from there, but I've never lived there and would love some advice from people who aren't family. So any opinions / advice are welcome!  


\- How easy would it be to find an apartment close-ish to the city centre for around £850 - 900pcm?  
\- Is it relatively easy to find apartments that accept inside cats? (Had a lot of trouble with this in London)  
\- Are there any parts of Edinburgh that perhaps we should avoid moving to?  
\- Are there any parts of Edinburgh that you recommend moving to?  
\- Best pubs / venues in Edinburgh? (I love Whistle Binkies, so maybe something similar?)  


Thanks in advance, guys!"

Golf seems to be pretty controversial around these parts, due to the amount of space it takes up, this thread isn't for that 😂

Well I've decided if you can't beat them join them. Golf looks like a lot of fun. Edinburgh has a lot to choose from locally. I know a few people who play it pretty well. My place of work takes us on a golfing holiday every year, and i probably suffer promotion wise because I don't play, shouldn't be the case, but I understand why.

So that being said, I've bought in, and am willing to put a bit of effort in, and hopefully further down the line enjoy it too! I have a set of irons 4-sw (Callaway x22 if you care), a bag gifted to me + accessories. So i'm still needing a putter and 3w probably, but i'm not going near a course yet so they can wait until i see something relevant.

What driving ranges do people recommend for total beginners (Edinburgh and near has a wealth of options!). Hopefully them being friendly and good value for me? I live in Leith for reference, and have a car if that helps.

Also i'm certainly looking to get lessons very early on. I want to start properly, and not form habits that are hard to change later. Any recommendations here? Groups or Private, covid has probably made that all quite difficult right now. What are the costs of lessons I should be factoring in?

Watching a lot of total beginner youtube golf videos (godbless youtube!) so practicing the utter basics (ie. not holding the club upside down and left foot forward 😝). But would like to put grip, swing, body rotation etc into practice without endangering anyone, which golf balls seem pretty good at doing."

I'm on a UK visa and plan on moving in November(-ish) to Edinburgh with my partner. I'm looking to live in Old Town/ City Centre as I've been planning on this move for a few years now. I want to live in the middle of it all. We don't drive but it seems the bus system is decent in the city if we want to visit further out of town. We are currently planning to look for a 2 bedroom flat for £1,100pm max, hoping for something with at least a tiny sort of ~~ charm ~~ that we wouldn't have in Toronto, with a washer. Is that completely unrealistic?

I have current experience in sales/marketing/events and a diploma in event planning. Obviously edinburgh was initially good for this but with the current climate, less so. For such a large city, are events or retail jobs regularly very scarse atm? I've looked on and off but not much recently because it's become a bit depressing. Partner has a bachelors in video game programming, but the only games company he found was Rockstar. Is there a secret hub of small games companies that anyone knows about? We are plannong to apply for positions before we move up there (currently in England) but I'm not sure how realistic that plan is either.

TLDR: Is £1100ppm too little for a flat budget for old town/ City centre for a 2br with washer and 'charm'? Are events and video game company jobs really as limited as they seem online currently?"

I, for one, don't tend to hold my head perpendicular to the ground when walking around town; can't really see why it's any better than bog-standard horizontal text. I guess if you were to approach the station from town, it might be easier to read (?) than horizontal signage but surely it would be better to have a larger sign on the old facade that actually faces towards Princes St (but perhaps that might be difficult due to listed building status)? Moreover, since that part of the new extension is angled away from the road, the sign is pretty well hidden from view (see picture) unless you are walking towards Haymarket on the pavement on the north side of the road. 

Or is it more in keeping with modern architectural tastes...is there anyone out there who just prefers the look of a vertical, less easily-readable sign?

Love to hear folk's thoughts on this!

if3564,Red flags discovered on the property we are about to buy - Are we overreacting?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/if3564/red_flags_discovered_on_the_property_we_are_about/,olver111,1,2020-08-23 22:55:38,23,/r/Edinburgh/comments/if3564/red_flags_discovered_on_the_property_we_are_about/,NA," 

We are just in the process of buying a property in Edinburgh. We had our offer accepted a couple of weeks ago at a good price and our mortgage offer should come in any day now. This week, we went to talk to the neighbours and discovered some red flags. 

There are 8 flats in the shared tenement building, no factor. At the viewing, we were told that each flat pays 1/8th of the repairs and that the neighbours are pretty good at working together and getting things done. The stairwell would be painted soon. 

After talking to the neighbours, we found out that none of this is the case. There was a big water damage in the building which took very long to fix and not everybody stepping up to the cost. There is still damage to the hallway 6 years later which I assume is what the property agent was talking about regarding a renovation. One owner has been pushing for 6 years to get that fixed and nothing happened. We asked about the roof repairs, these were done 10 years ago to fix some storm damage and 5 years ago to fix some slate tiles, but no maintenance or checks since. Granted, we did not specifically ask for a roof maintenance history so this one is on us, but it is the first time we are buying so we are learning. We are in Scotland and trusted the home report too much, but turns out the surveyor did not even look at the roof because you cannot see it from the ground.

We talked to our solicitor about that, but it was not helpful at all. He said we should not trust the neighbours because they may not like the seller (the neighbour was actually so excited to have homeowners move in and no more students, so I don't think so). He did not care about the wrong information regarding the handling of building repairs and regarding the stairwell renovation, just said that these issues will be in any unfactored property. He also said if we ask the owners about it this late in the process they might just put the flat back on the market and warned us not to say anything. We pay a LOT of money, so we do not feel comfortable proceeding if we have any concerns and we'd rather ask.

Our main concerns are:

Lack of maintenance on the roof. We would like to do a roof survey for peace of mind that no bigger costs will come with it. Are we too late asking for that days before the missives are due to be concluded?

Lack of cooperation between the owners causing extra costs and work for the live-in owners and the fact that we were given wrong information from the seller. My partner would actually like to ask for a reduction in sell price because of that. I am not sure if that is wise or even possible. What is your thought on that?"

It looks like Wester Hailes gets a good range of choice through Just Eat so I'm posting here to maybe reduce the amount of disappointment and wasted money over the few takeaways.

I usually get salt &amp; chilli chips and chicken bites and sometimes sesame prawn toast. The boyfriend is more adventurous, but he normally orders either chicken satay (off the skewer) or beef with peppers in a black bean sauce and fried rice.

I’m looking for some family day trip ideas - one toddler (2 years old) and one baby.

We’re visiting Sept 14-18th and most likely will be staying central. I guess the zoo will be an obvious starting point but I’ll have my car so thinking a trip out to East Lothian for some beach visits perhaps and ideally some good seafood (any recommendations?)

Would be good to find a petting farm/zoo, playgrounds, or anything to entertain a 2 year old. Perhaps some nice woodland walks. 

I’m quite keen also for an up close view of the Forth bridge so maybe a trip to QueensFerry. 

Any other worthwhile visits?"

I'm going to be moving from Manchester to Edinburgh soon for uni to study CS.

I have a few questions.
1. Has anyone done this trip, I'm going to be alone so how do I possibly move up there with all my stuff from my flat. Vam services? Train or plane?
2. Should I get uni accomodations or can I possibly find a studio flat?
3. Any CS students? How is the course? how is Edinburgh in general? Any graduates? How's the job market afterwards.

An odd question but will I have to pay the 10k fee for uni as I did my A levels in Manchester or will I be exempt because I'm Irish and don't hold a British passport.

Now, as I said, she has not received any notification from the council about this at all. No initial letter to pay it off or any reminders. There's also no information about the time that this happened just a date that was on the letter from the debt collection agency. 

She has just went up to the council building but as it's closed she's not sure what her next options are? Also, as she's just paid it, is she now able to challenge it? 

Obviously if she's used the bus lane incorrectly, then that's on her and she would have taken the fine but for it to nearly a full year without hearing anything seems a bit steep.

We also have a decent sized flat in Canonmills so we can host if need be as well. Write me a DM, then we can take it from there.

It was 1930 before either of the two floor staff (on a Friday night) came to see us. They were clearly rushed off their feet with a full house and takeaway orders. We ordered and waited...and waited.

Drinks and one starter arrived at 2000. We were assured the others were on the way. By 2030 nothing more had appeared apart from a crowd of clearly pre-booked, and increasingly disgruntled, diners gathering outside.

We decided to cut our losses, went up to the till and said we would pay for the drinks and leave. I took out my card and was told they didn't have a machine at the moment. I was handed a scrap of paper with a name, account number and sort code, and asked to transfer money there.

I have recently been offered a job in Edinburgh and I'm already staying in travel lodge to look for properties in the area. 

Unfortunately, I haven't been very successful to secure a room or one bed flat. My budget is flexible and I'll be living alone for some time before my partner joins me as well. That's why I'm more interested to rent a room for a couple of months before I decide which place to rent a flat.

I am more interested in a room preferably walking distance from Royal Infirmary so I can commute to work easily. I will be buying a cheap bike to commute to work if needed (preferably 10 minutes cycling to work) 

Some people have warned me that some areas around Royal Infirmary are a bit dodgy and thus I should think of finding accommodation a bit away from it. 

I have already joined Facebook group which has Edinburgh rooms and properties and posted there as well without any help. I am also looking at spare room and right move. Maybe people are a bit worried about me being a healthcare professional? 

I like to keep to myself, respect everyone and not too much 

1. Which areas should I avoid around royal infirmary?
2. I'll prefer to be closer to my work , but if there's no choice at all, what will be nearest place to stay?
3. I only thing I'm worried about is , the place shouldn't have parties everyday , or a pub or bar around where there be lots of noise and dogdy teenagers or small gangs. Other than that, I'm okay with any part of Edinburgh as long as it is close to my work. 

I want to move by 15th of September if that's helpful. 

Thanks alot everyone !"

Essentially, I’d like to be removed enough to have my privacy while still being close enough to the city to be able to make trips in when I want.

A little about me: I’m a 30 yo American but have lived in both Genoa, Italy (2010) and Sydney, Australia (2014-2015) for varying amounts of time and traveled pretty extensively throughout Asia. I probably would be looking to move in about 3 years so I understand that a lot can change between now and then.

What I’m looking for is any advice on moving to Scotland, general areas that may be of interest for me to look at living, and local real estate agents/agencies, maybe that focus more on rural properties, that could help me when the time to move gets closer.

I do have several friends that live in Edinburgh that have tuned me into East/West Lothian and New Berwick."

So I have been recently applying for jobs and got an offer from Venture 100. Ever since a bad experience with a company called The Hive Collective in Glasgow back in 2018, I have been very cautious about job offerings. Especially ones that come too easy, from companies with minimal information available on them.

Initially I felt skeptical when I researched into Venture 100, but sat through a small 10 minute(ish) interview today with their Managing Director Matthew Vella. After the interview, I saw some similarities in how Matthew Vella not only presenting himself, but his questions, and avoidance of my own questions with that of Matthew Stewart.

Matthew Stewart owns and operates (currently) Omada Corp aka OGC Holdings, previously known as The Hive Collective. Turns out Matthew Stewart and Matthew Vella are connected on LinkedIN, and not only that, Matthew Vella recommends Matthew Stewart for various skills.

How does NXT Wave fit in? I found a photograph (thanks to an Edinburgh Live article) with Matthew Vella and NXT Wave's owner (and a bunch of other people).

It seems all these companies are linked and have the same business model of using people's labour and time for minimal (if any) ROI for the individual.

Common claims these companies make:

* Base salary per year in adverts
* Training schemes
* Uncapped earning potential
* Running your own team in a matter on months/up to a year

My experience is that the reality is much different, usually only commissioned based work (in terms of my experience with The Hive Collective). I have compiled a source list where I found all the connecting information.

TLDR; consider all the information available when engaging with Venture 100. Due to its connection to companies like The Hive Collective, Omada Corp, NXT Wave. 

Please also avoid the use of slander, or anything that can be deemed defamation in the comments. We need to keep this post up and avoid getting silenced by any legal tricks these companies usually employ.

You all have been very kind to me regarding my previous query of finding accommodation near Royal Infirmary. I really appreciate it. 

I recently moved to Edinburgh ( 10 days ago) and now I'm looking for a bike (single gear fixie preferably) to commute to work and maybe a bit of groceries. I'm 6 1' so looking for an adult bike.  

I'm unsure if I should get an old bike or a new cheap bike.  Someone told me bikes get nicked very easily in Edinburgh so I'm not really sure in this regards.My bike would be parked at royal infirmary most of the time as I'll be working there.

Regarding new and old , I'm unsure about it because at times costs of repairs of an old bike are not worth the trouble and not a good investment. Someone told me about Edinburgh Bike Station for advice and others said get a 100£ bike off sport direct or somewhere cheap.

I'm not looking to spend more than 200£ ( maybe max of 230). So what do you guys think I should invest in considering long term costs and maintenance ?

The reason for fixie is , it is easy to maintain in my opinion as there are no gears or extra spare parts I need to think about. 


Anyone feeling very generous or want to get rid of a bike in working condition can swap it something like chocolate/ or anything I can help them with like phone software repairs / computers / Linux / anything like that.

People who need help with their phones/ PC / etc but don't have anything to swap are welcomed to contact me as well. I'll help them for free if I can )


I had eyes on this bike Elops 500 Fixie but it is out of stock now unfortunately. https://www.decathlon.co.uk/elops-500-single-speed-blue-id_8549624.html"

I live just off Albert St and because of the amount of double-parking on that street, it's a nightmare to traverse. When I lived in Bruntsfield and walked down through Morningside for some exercise, Morningside Road was a stressed-out mobile traffic jam as well.

Couldn't the council maybe take some ground in each of these residential areas and build some 'resident permit' multi-stories or something, and then ban on-street parking in the main through-roads except for temporary loading/unloading?

I appreciate the push is toward reducing cars in the city, but ultimately people aren't going to completely get rid of their cars for a long time, and the seemingly perpetual roadworks all over the city are causing real congestion problems which could be eased considerably without cars lining the main public transport routes.

A handful of multi-level car parks, with security and decent CCTV, could solve this imo. Would create some jobs too, and make commuting via public transport easier too, not to mention making life a bit easier for those fit-types who choose to cycle around the place.

Am I just being completely mad here?"

Sorry for the bummer post. 

A relative of mine (outside of the UK) has been diagnosed with Cancer which has spread rapidly. He is 15 years old his mother has a business which she’s prepared to sell to support her child’s treatment. The dad sadly is not earning. The type of cancer is responsive to chemotherapy and I think this is what his parents are pursuing. 

I think the cost looks something like £20k

Anyway I’m a very active person in my local community. I get involved with fundraisers, I volunteer in multiple places for over 10 years, I love to organise and support all kinds of practical causes! 

I’ve never, however, been hit close to home with something like this. On paper I feel confident in my abilities to fundraise and to find ways to contribute. 

I believe my family and my cousins family can definitely pull up their socks and find £10k within the coming weeks. I’m going to look to raise more by extending my fundraising skills beyond that. I was looking for your advise on ways to fundraise! 

1. I don’t have huge skills, my day job is in education. But I can maybe think of ways to use these skills to run online classes or workshops in exchange for money that 100% will go towards fundraising 

2. I don’t have a car but I can maybe consider odd jobs and things to do in Edinburgh for people who can afford a skivvy and need my services 

3. I could create a smaller target fund through just giving or go fund me. However I think it’s a big ask to expect strangers on social media or friends/colleagues to contribute during these hard Covid times for some random kid in another country. Do you know any websites where maybe I can offer a service in exchange for donations? Something to make it worthwhile 

4. eBay sales tho I think I have nothing valuable but every little will help! 


Putting on events or bake sales at work isn’t possible right now. Your advice and guidance on cool ways to fundraise would be ace! 

Thank you for reading my post. Take care and go hug your loved ones!"

I'm moving to a new flat in the city soon, and I'm trying to get all my personal details up to date on various systems. The problem I'm facing is that some of them don't allow you to manually enter address details, and so I'm worried I'm going to select the wrong place.

So, (for illustration purposes - fake address for obvious reasons!), let's say I'm moving to Flat 13, 7 New Address Road.

On the Royal Mail redirect service, it has the following options;

13/7 New Address Road  
or  
7/13 New Address Road

This is the first time I've been in a place where the flat hasn't had a letter in it, or hasn't been called ""Flat (x)"" in the addresses.

Can anyone help clarify? I'd already gone with the ""13/7"" format in a few things before I noticed the alternative version. Have I fucked up?"

I was born in Germany but when I arrived in Edinburgh in 2013, I knew within a week that I had found my place and wanted to stay there forever. I became a citizen in 2017. I stayed until 2019 and leaving broke my heart. I cried 3-4/7 days for like six months. And then another 1/week for the next three. 

I miss living and breathing this city. The way it feels in the summer but also the haar and the creepiness around Samhuinn. I miss everything about Edinburgh except the shitty job I used to have. 

I moved back to Germany. The quality of housing is so much better, and the quality of healthcare. In the summer, we get six weeks of proper summer sunshine and swim in the sea, sandy white shores. Objectively, everything is better in Germany except I‘m not at home in this country I was born in. I feel out of place and being here feels like sandpaper rubbing against my psyche. 

I miss Edinburgh so much.

Not because the product is rubbish, but there is very little that actually saturates even 50/60% of the connection.

I personally got it as part of an offer for £35 a month and have learned that the rest of the internet has to catch up to deal with the higher bandwidth, also with plans to move out the city i probably won't see Gigabit for long time.

 I'm not searching for a teacher, and I will not ask you to teach me Korean aha. If I do, I will definitely pay though. 

I'm an illustrator, graphic designer/student, so If you are into art could be a nice ice breaker too ! I'm asking here after looking on meetups (well now we can't do that anyway aha) or facebook groups.

Currently rent with DJ Alexander so have written off getting the majority/any of my deposit back. Obviously don't want to be charged through the nose for extras so I'm trying to make sure the place will be left in an even better state than we got it. Which won't be hard as it wasn't exactly that good!

The biggest one being that a few years ago after a few too many drinks on Christmas Eve I managed to fall into the sliding mirrored doors of the built in wardrobes. One of them is now pretty badly damaged. It still works completely fine but the mirror is badly cracked. Now, I thought it would have been easy to get a replacement but they seem to be a size that I can't just buy off the shelf having looked at most of the major DIY places. There's other custom made places online but they're unbelievably expensive and more for brand spanking new custom built wardrobes.

Has anyone been in this position before? Probably not...

Could I buy smaller ones and adjust the opening of the wardrobe? Get a joiner into add some wood to the bottom/top and replace both doors?

Should I just tell the landlord and take the hit? 

Is it possible to just replace the mirror part? 

Should I phone up my insurance company and see what they say? 

Thanks as always!"

(We like to just wander around and see where the day takes us - you stick to the Hop-On-Hop-Off Buses, you see so little of a city.)  So we're thinking 2022 at this point, or 2023 if the timing is better.

I did find the post for people looking to travel, and god knows I've got plenty of time to research at the moment, so I'm fine looking for stuff to do and can research where to stay on my own.  (Not to mention, I'm sure that landscape of attractions, restaurants, and hotels will change markedly over the next year or two anyway.)  But, I was wondering if residents had recommendations for a good off-peak time to visit?

For comparison, I grew up in the Washington, DC area - I always tell people to visit from mid-September to mid-October.  The weather has cooled down to tolerable levels, the summer tourists are gone, the big school trips that clog up the museums/monuments/Capitol Building haven't started yet, and if you time it right, there can still be some pretty good exhibitions at the various museums that are hanging on after the end of tourist season.  So while you miss some big festivals and events, you end up having a lot more breathing room, and can have a nice, loosely scheduled visit where you can discover some things off the beaten path.

We were thinking between late-March and mid-May.  It seems to be an off-time for your biggest festivals (though we'd definitely be cool with the Science Festival).  We're okay with whatever weather is thrown at us - we were actually blessed with lots of cool, crisp, sunny days when we visited in September, 2018, so we figure we had our ""unicorn"" experience. 🤣  Besides, we currently live in the state of Minnesota, so in March and April, ANY weather you have is better than here. (It's usually still snowing...and not small storms either!)

I will note that we do want to try to hit a seafood shack, either in Edinburgh or someplace we could day-trip by rail or bus.  There really didn't seem to be one of those we could find in September in Edinburgh. We did hit Ship on the Shore for lunch to get langoustine tails, but I am much happier walking up to a shack and getting something fresh. (I grew up on the water, so I love seafood shacks.) For example, I see the [Lobster Shack in North Berwick](https://www.instagram.com/lobstershacknb/) looks like a good option, and there's a train that only takes 30 minutes to get there - we're totally fine with something like that.  But if there's something in Edinburgh itself, that would be awesome, too.  But I know those can be seasonal, and I just have no idea what months they would be open.

So is March-May a good timeframe?  Or is September a still the best time to visit?  That did seem to be the month Edinburgh takes a breather after the Tattoo and Fringe and I know we didn't have much trouble getting around, getting into the various attractions, or slipping into most restaurants.

Thanks for any input you can share.  Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy!"

I just wanted to write about my first experience in Edinburgh. Japanese, living in the UK for 3+ years. 

Was looking to experience the rich culture of Scotland first hand. So I made the trip to come to Edinburgh. I went on a 12 hour tour of Lochness today and learned a lot of tales from my tour guide. 

I found it very fascinating that Japan has a lot of similarities with Scottish culture, as both had ancient clans that held harmonious rule over the fertile lands. I learned about the sad Glencoe massacre, Jacobite rebellions, William Wallace and a lot about whiskey production. I immediately found a similarity with the Scottish warriors’ proud nationalism and love for the art of good alcohol with the ancient Samurai.

I was contemplating on settling somewhere in the UK different from where I currently live. I haven’t found somewhere that really resonated. Scotland seemed promising. Maybe find a career and invest my life here someday, I thought. 

As the day ended, The tour guide thanked our group for travelling during the pandemic as it enables Scots like him to keep a job during hard times.

On my way back to the hotel, I walked past a group of 3 locals who then called out to me to say “Watch out China!”.

I tried to see what they were on about and told them that I am Japanese.

They then just raise their fists and say “Yeah yeah power to the people!” then walked away laughing. 

I definitely wasn’t ready to feel subhuman after such a great day of sights and whiskey. I walked back to the hotel hiding my face as I wasn’t sure if there was a race issue here. 

Here I am in my hotel room, and not really feeling like going out for dinner on my last night. Sitting and feeling disturbed.

Instead, I’m sitting in silence reading up on race issues the city had e.g. 

https://youtu.be/KwD9_iLddBk?t=1743

Was I just unfortunate to have this experience? Is this just increased due to the Wuhan virus?

I really like Scotland, but would rather not waste time where the likes of me are not welcome. Also I don’t want to let those 3 men define my perception of Edinburgh.

Thanks for reading.
Kind honesty would greatly be appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you for all of the kind words! 😱
I will not let this experience define my memory of this trip. You’ve all been insightful with my lack of experience here. Moving forward and getting myself some fine Islay gold! Slàinthe Mhath, enjoy your weekend! ❤️🥃"

This is a different to the norm post so if it's not cool, sorry! 

I live in Edinburgh and I've had all my work cancelled due to the plague (COVID). So I started developing an app and I'd like to know what you think of the idea before I invest any more time into it... 

Imagine an app where you can type in any location (let's say the Grassmarket for an example) and a distance (let's say 1km). And it will find all the businesses in that area, then find all their latest tweets (to start with) and show you exactly what's going on in that area. 

The idea of the app is to help people discover what local businesses are doing / promoting, etc but also if / when we can travel, you can type in the place you're driving to and discover what's going on there as well. 

As the app develops, I want to offer the option to filter by business type (so if you're looking for restaurants only in an area etc), and to include more social media sites.i 

Is this the sort of thing you'd use? Open to all thoughts and suggestions. I've started building a prototype but I wanted to get a feel for what people think of it as an idea ( I did some market research earlier, but things have changed so much in the last few months I wanted to ask a bigger group again).

I have a kid who will be in S3 or S4 and I’m trying to find where to live and how to get him into school. My partner will be working in Morningside (I’m not sure where I’ll be working yet) but there’s no room at any of the schools in the area (Boroughmuir, Gillespie’s, St. Thomas of Aquin’s). We are trying to figure out where to rent. I’m looking for some advice about which neighborhoods are worth moving to knowing that there aren’t spaces in the schools near Morningside, which is where the wiki recommends. Are Tynecastle or Firhill ok?  And how does the system work when kids move into a catchment area and everything is full? In the US any kid that moves into the district is given a spot at the catchment school, so we’re just confused about the process in Scotland. We will consider living in another neighborhood if there is a good school nearby with space and my partner can reasonably commute, but it’s hard for us to know at a distance if there are any schools we should avoid, or any that we should go out of our way to live near. We can’t really afford independent schools but we will also not qualify for a lot of assistance. And given that we are moving mid-year any aid wouldn’t kick in until next Autumn, anyway.

We prefer to be in or close to the city proper. Wherever we rent, we hope to soon buy a home within a year or two and don’t want our kid to have to switch schools. So the city seems to make more sense than the outlying area. Thanks for any advice."

As stated up there, I don't care much for the authentic cuisine experience. Far too uncultured for that. I'm really just after your recommendations for the typical style takeaway that isn't going to break the bank and tastes good if anyone has any.

If we settle for a house a little out of the centre, we'd like a neighbourhood where we can still walk to pubs/restaurants, and still get into town by public transport. We eat and drink a lot LOL!

I and my wife are thinking about moving to a flat that is in Clovenstone Gardens, which is basically adjacent to Wester Hails. The flat and surroundings seem very nice but I have had a look through this subreddit and the SIMD and Wester Heils looks almost like an equivalent of Chechnya.

It would be super helpful if someone who currently lives there could confirm that or if someone else knows if it is still such a rough area or it is more thing of past and people just keep repeating it?

Thanks a lot."

So we have a seven month old puppy and 90% of our interactions with people in street when we have the dog with us have been extremely sweet and understanding. As she is a typical excitable puppy, she does jump and try to play with other dogs and even sometimes younger children. Never has she barked or been aggressive to any other people or dogs either.

Recently we've been starting training her off the lead, always done in parks and far from roads etc. Unfortunately this has meant she's run off to play with people or other dogs and we have to catch up and get her back on the lead. Again most people have been lovely BUT there is some people who really do not know how to handle a playful dog coming to say hello and make some real arsehole decisions. 

Firstly, please don't continue on your run or jog if my dog has come to say hello. You are now just running away with my dog and you need to understand I can't make up the 100m gap on you whilst you're still running away. Just stop and let me get my dog.

Secondly, if you don't want a dog to chase you then don't start running and screaming. It's a puppy and it wants to play, you've just started a game of chase and are making a fun new sound.

Honestly, today a women had a real go at me after she continually ran away (she was on a jog) with my dog trying to play with her and her big aggressive dog. She then gave me the incredibly patronising tip that I should train my dog to come back (which takes time for any puppy to get).  Then explained her dog was aggressive and would bite my dog (I never mentioned she should f\*cking train her dog then). All this would have been avoided if she had stopped then second my dog came to say hello and play.

Basically, there's a lot of new dog owners out there, if a puppy comes to say hi to you whilst you're out then please just stop and make sure the owners get their dog back.

Thanks"

So since I have come into quite close contact with her for a 10 hour shift, I am assuming I have the virus even tho no symptoms. However my work is saying that there is no issue as I have no symptoms and I can keep working. To me this sounds wrong considering I could and probably have the virus, also think out of moral duty I should assume I have it and self isolate until 10-12 days! 
My work plans to not put me if I do so but I still think u should isolate to try and not danger my fellow employees! 

Am I correct? Does this go online with guidelines ?

In Romania  the public health system is (almost) shit, so if you are priviledged enough you go private. Which I did for most medical needs and issues that did not threathen to kill me over night. And it was easy: pick a private practice, schedule, pay and doctor would make me well.

But the UK health system makes no sense to me ... yet. I have been here for more than two years, and I still don't have a GP, because the practice for my area does not accept new patients.  What to do in this case? The NHS site does not give any advice, besides just calling practices in your area until one of them accepts you. 

Anyway, I am fortunate enough to have a decent paying job that comes with private insurance. So I can get access to a GP for basic things.

But, I've sprained my knee this weekend. It is my bad knee, that has suffered more than one injury over the years , but the fact that is the second time this year is pretty worrying to me. It is a clear sign it needs a serious checkup and probably an operation to fix it. So I've talked to one of the private GPs, and he has given me a refferal to The Spire Murrayfield Hospital for further investigations. I called and tried to schedule an appointment and I was basically told: ""We'll get back to you, but keep in mind there is a pandemic happening, so it might take a while"". And I understand that. That is why I did not imediately run to the hospital when it happened. 

But after two days in bed and a knee double the size it should be, I am starting to panic. What if they never call?  It is not a critical injury, the swelling will go down and my leg will probably still be usable to some degree. But I need to get this fixed and I have no idea where to start.  So, people that have relocated here and locals I need your help. 

Other info: I am not a citizen, but I've been approved to stay here for the next five years.  I am alone in Edinburgh,  no local friends. My only friend is an Italian guy that has never needed a GP either. At this point I am desperate enough to go to a private practice, it's only money after all, and as long as I am healthy I can make some more. So, any private orthopedics practices you could recommend?

Somebody please, give me some pointers, because I am a very energetic person, not not being able to trust one of my legs when doing anything it's destroying me mentally. 

Thank you in advance!"

I moved into an old (19th century) tenement flat last year. We have a beautiful fireplace but unfortunately it has been blocked up. We're unsure if it has just been blocked at our fireplace itself or if the flue has been capped off at the chimney outlet. For information we're on the 1st floor of a 4 storey block so the distance between our fireplace and the chimney is substantial.

I'd love to get it re-opened if possible but haven't the first clue about how to go about it and the potential costs. Does anyone have a recommendation for a decent builder/contractor/chimney sweep etc. who would be able to come out and take a look at it and give me an estimate of the costs involved?

I've asked around and had a google but not many people seem to have open fires in tenements anymore so not really getting anywhere."

I'll probably go with either Voxi (Vodafone) or GiffGaff (O2), unless anyone recommends anything better.

So I've just bought a new car, and I already have a parking permit. 

On the Edinburgh parking permit website it gives the option to transfer the permit to another vehicle. I put all the details of the new car, uploaded my v5, and it found it, great! Then I went to transfer the permit and it even said you can do so ""10,000 times a year"" - so unlimited effectively - great! I was about ready to praise how smooth the whole thing was, but no, of course that would never be the case with Edinburgh council...

Now the status of the permit has changed to ""pending"", the registration on the permit is my old one, and there is no mention of the new car. 

So my question is pretty basic - will I now be liable for parking tickets on the new car while they process all this?

Obviously I couldn't have done it any sooner, I just got the car today. Usually when you renew you get an email right away to confirm it's all fine, wait a week for the paper one but you can park as usual. I assumed it would be the same for a transfer but since I've heard nothing now I feel I'll have to pay for parking for a few days until it's sorted.

Does anyone have a similar experience? Did you get a different response when you updated it. Did anyone not pay for parking on ""pending"" and it was fine?

Any help appreciated! Sorry for the massive post..."

I'm currently in the unfortunate and unexpected situation of having to move during the pandemic. I'm a 30yo professional female looking for a 1-bed flat (budget around £750 for rent w/o bills). I would like to live in or around the city center where I work, OR in a safe area with good transport links (around 20-30 mins to the center by bus). I'm looking for some advice:

\- which areas to go for/avoid (I have already read topics on this but new perspectives are always appreciated) 

\- I see many nice looking ground floor flats that are available at the moment, but I'm a bit concerned safety-wise (break-ins, etc.). Would you go for ground floor flats in specific areas?

\- if I let directly from a landlord (I have so far only rented via agencies) what should I look for? should I be particularly careful with something?

\- it seems like most agencies only offer virtual viewings at the moment. I'm very nervous about agreeing to and paying deposit for a flat that I've never visited myself. Is there any way to protect myself in case the flat has many issues that were not visible from a video/video call? 

Sorry for the many questions. My anxiety levels are shooting up and I'm trying to prepare myself as best as I can. Any response to my questions, or any advice for my situation in general will be highly appreciated! Cheers!"

I'm not actually from round your way, so hopefully you don't mind me gatecrashing your subreddit, but I’m working on a project that every single one of you can help with (if you want).

It's a slightly unusual request, so bear with me, but the info is below and also on my [website](https://www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain). And I'm happy to answer any questions!

# What’s the project?

I’m putting together **a collection of photographs taken by the people of UK and Ireland during lockdown.**

These will be printed into a hardback book later this year, as a memory of this strange few months and the many different ways in which lockdown has affected us. Each image will also have a short caption from the contributor, explaining why the image relates to their lockdown experience.

# Who can contribute?

Literally anyone in or from anywhere in the UK/Ireland. You do not need to be into photography, you do not need to have a beautiful image to share or an amazing story to tell. The point is to get submissions from all walks of life. If you have experienced lockdown in the British Isles in some way or another, I would love you to be part of this.

# What do I need?

1. **A photo.** As long as it relates to your experience of lockdown, anything goes. It could be something that brings you joy, or it might be something painful. Your highest high or your lowest low, or somewhere in between. It can be beautifully shot, or just a shitty blurry snap from your phone (this project isn’t about photography skills). It might capture a big cultural moment, or something small and personal, even just something totally mundane. People, objects, places, selfies, pets... anything goes. **It just needs to be related to lockdown, and mean something to you.**

&amp;#x200B;

Since students have been back into halls we've been having major issues with students partying and making noise from their flats in Sciennes. We've done the usual (contacted 101, uni accom services) and it's still going on. I feel like i'm going a bit mad as the response from the uni has been that, whilst they acknowledge some noise has been going on, it wasn't of too much note from the RA's there and as such the only thing to recommend is contact them when we feel the noise is too loud. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past there's been parties in the flats which is fine, especially during weekends or freshers week (I never want to decry a student party normally as I would be hypocrite to say that I hadn't indulged in flat parties in the past), and especially now if it's all within a household, but every other night for almost a month there have been parties going on till sometimes 2-3am with screaming and singing (if it helps, they do the usual pish song repertoire of abba, oasis etc). I've taken videos and pics of the offending flats but nothing has been done really and I honestly am starting to wonder if i'm being a right grump and going mad or if other people have had issues?

My dog always walks off leash in any park in London and is very good at it and I can’t imagine living somewhere he can never play off lead.

[EGG Discord](https://discord.gg/aswbPzK)

**---What is Edinburgh Gaming Group (EGG)?---**

Edinburgh Gaming Group is a community based on a love of \*mostly\* PC gaming. We have members that play anything you can think of. We host games nights frequently too in which we will gather a large amount of people to play the same game, this is often something a bit more niche such as Wreckfest, Garry's Mod or the very under-appreciated 2010 indie kart racing game [Zero Gear](https://store.steampowered.com/app/18820/Zero_Gear). We love a game of Among Us, or what ever is popular right now too :)

**---About Us---**

We started on this exact subreddit just looking for people to play games with and we've since grown leaps and bounds in the last 3 years. We've had over 1000 unique visitors, organised a whole host of online games nights and real life meetups. We try to have at least one ""official""

\-**-- How do I use this?---**

We use an app named Discord to operate what is essentially our chatroom, everything to do with the community happens on this app and the only time something happens outwith the app is when we do our IRL meetups. As soon as you sign up you will be able to join our community. When you join we recieve a notifcation and will be sure to say hey!

\-**-- So how do I join? ---**

All you have to do is click here &gt;&gt; [https://discord.gg/KwnV68B](https://discord.gg/KwnV68B)

**---I'm not in Edinburgh can I still join?---**

Of course, we have members from all over the UK and some even on the other side of the world. You'll just have to travel a wee bit more to the pub sessions but that's on your end."

Fortunately the price of renting is actually looking like it will be an improvement for us so we have some wiggle room in where we can choose to go.

Granted COVID is making many things a bit moot at the moment but we're currently thinking about either Leith or Stockbridge for renting initially and, should we find that we set down more permanent roots we would like to be in an area in which we could buy later down the track.

We're both pretty into getting out to nature when we can but during the week it's good to have a decent bit of food and drink, etc around to keep entertained without having to go too far.

Do those locations sound like they would be a good fit? I'm aware this might be a bit of a boring post and mods may want to remove it (if so I totally get it).

And how is the employment market right now ? I figured I’ll start working maybe in 2 months after my move while I wait for my national insurance card to come in. 

Also any idea on what safe neighbourhoods to live in? I’m a single 30 year female and this is my first time I’ll be on my own so I’m nervous about that ! Is it possible to live by the sea and commute to city centre easily as well? 

Any advice and tips will be appreciated!

Why would it have been put there? If you follow the sign, it takes you down to the [junction of Lanark Road and Slateford Road](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@55.9242625,-3.2460336,3a,31.1y,280.51h,93.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sI2HrIWk0cxKrJxIUE74q3w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), at which point there's no mention of the airport. And if you correctly guess that it's probably quicker to head out towards the Forth Road Bridge, there's no signage either at the next junction (where Google Maps suggests the quickest route is probably to head through Longstone towards Calder Road), or at Gillespie Crossroads (where you'd be better turning right towards Wester Hailes, as Lanark Road then continues over the bypass with no link-up).

Coupled with that, to even *see* that sign, you've come from Colinton/Oxgangs sort of direction, and starting from those... you'd be better off heading out to the bypass in the first place!

So why the heck's that one airport sign there?

Utter trivia I know - I just happened to be at that junction, noticed the sign again, and had that 'whyyyyy?' thought."

The city centre is cleaned to create a good image for the tourists but the rest is a mess. UK is the dirties western country I've ever been to and Edinburgh is just a pure example of this.  I'm really surprised these problems are not addressed. If people don't understand the purpose of cleaning after themselves we must force them by strict laws and tickets. This is what happens in other countries and cities. Especially now when people are more aware what consequences to the planet things like plastic, pollution, overpopulation have. In the city ( in Europe) where I come from there used to be a big problem with dogs poo. The dog owners couldn't be bothered to clean after their dogs did their business, especially in winter. When the snow melted the whole city was looking like a one massive loo. The council introduced new local law where all the dog owners were obliged to register their dogs and have DNA tests. Then the cleaners were walking around the town every now and again, picking the dogs' poo, doing DNA tests to check which dog that poo belongs to and sending tickets to the owners. The 'smelly' problem has been resolved within a week... Eventually they took it a bit further and forbid going for a walk with a dog without a lead as the dogs were jumping on the cycling paths and were causing bike accidents, some of them very serious, which  by the way also notoriously happens in Edinburgh.

Another example is every Friday and Saturday night when wild and savage party goers wreck the whole town. Most of them are not even from here, they come from England, Ireland and other places. They throw fish and Chips all over the pavement, vomit on the streets etc. And then we have to pay so much money for council tax, just because certain services such as cleaning the city centre after every weekend needs to be kept.

My question is: Why nobody has addressed this problem with Scottish government and the council so far? Don't you think Edinburgh, the city with such a great old architecture and so much history should be kept safe and clean?

I currently go to the Ocean Terminal PureGym and it’s MOBBED 24/7... I go at 8:30 on weekdays and I can’t get a squat rack/bench half the time and it delays my workouts.

Looking for a place with great free weights/racks/benches etc, don’t really use the machines at all. Also not looking to spend crazy money (35,40 quid) I had a look at the Edinburgh Uni gym but they don’t seem to be taking any members from the community :( 

Any suggestions?

Thanks"

So I know there's a few post about this but none are fairly recent. I'm in the process of organizing a move to Scotland in late November and I'll be moving with a friend. I own a bordel collie and a cat and my friend owns a border collie and 2 cats, so between the 2 of us we have 5 pets.

What are our chances to finding a two bedroom place if we're okay with renting up to 15 miles from the city so around Edinburgh? I don't see anything about pets on right move, there's no filter for ""pet friendly only"" nor anything mentioned in the flat's description. 

I'd appreciate any advice you could give me! Thank you so much. 

(Also, what's the job market like with covid right now for small jobs like call centers or hospitality/tourism jobs? When we first get there we're both going to find that kind of job to give us time to find more permanent ones in our fields.) 

Thank youuuuuu!"

Maybe I'm looking at it with rose-coloured glasses hoping the area is now very well developed because I liked the flat so much. Or... Maybe it has actually changed a lot since the high-crime rates of the 80's and 90's...?

I live in one of these similar flats : [https://espc.com/news/post/regulation-on-short-term-lets-in-scotland-explained](https://espc.com/news/post/regulation-on-short-term-lets-in-scotland-explained) (pic inside website). I have recently moved here for a month but the noise starts bugging me a bit when I study and work from home. Would there be any different to the noise pollution if I lived somewhere else? Should I move to somewhere quieter or just deal with the noise? Appreciate your comments"

Anyone have any tips on how to bring down the cost? A friend mentioned getting a dehumidifier as it would take the cold moisture out of the air, so could be better than a cheap electric heater.

I'm curious what people think about this. For those that haven't visited, Jupiter Artland is an outdoor art park just outside Edinburgh. It's essentially the art collection of a couple who owns a large countryside estate that's also open to the public for five months every year. They recently emailed people on their mailing list, encouraging them to write to local councillors and MPs to oppose a planned housing development in the area. They claim that the development will destroy the views of the estate and change the visual context of the artworks located there; it might also mean that artists are less likely to work with them in the future. Now, I absolutely love Jupiter Artland and I feel a little conflicted about this. I understand why they might want to preserve the views of the park and how it benefits the public but it also seems a little hypocritical of people living on an 80-acre estate to oppose the building of much needed housing. I'm curious what people's thoughts are.

Looking for recommendations for gyms ideally close to Newington that aren't full of posers / young fit people. I work the typical 9-5 so most likely would be going in the evening and weekend. Will mostly do cardio I think with a little weights but I assume they'll tailor a programme for you when you go for induction? Not over fussed about swimming etc at this time. 

I also assume most are taking the covid regs seriously so are much of a muchness in that regard? I'm conscious Nicola might decide gyms need to close again soon but to be honest I'd rather try and crack on now as another 6 months could quite easily pass."

Please help with my research project!**

Hello everyone!

I am a final year Landscape Architecture student at The University of Edinburgh. I am currently doing my dissertation which studies the preferences of children (&lt;13 y.o.) and older adults for public green space and aims to **come up with guidance for the future design of green space which supports meaningful interaction between grandchildren and grandparents**.

This study is very dear to me as I come from Bulgaria, where multigenerational families are the norm and grandparents traditionally play an immense role in bringing up their grandchildren. I was raised largely by my maternal great-grandmother and value the relationship I have with her to this day. I have also spent many years in different childcare jobs and am passionate about healthy child development, which is proven to benefit greatly from meaningful relationships with (social) grandparents. However, my observations point me to the unfortunate fact that these relationships are not accommodated in the urban landscape. The ambition is to study and change this trend.

To begin my research, I have set up a quick online questionnaire to understand the preferences children and older adults (grandparents) have for green space in Edinburgh. **For the answers to be conducive to the study, it would be ideal if questionnaires are completed individually from the perspective of both grandchild and grandparent**. Due to ethical concerns about working directly with children, the questionnaire is to be completed by the parent/guardian/grandparent, by asking the child and simply conveying their response. Grandparents are then welcome to complete the same questionnaire for themselves.

It would mean a lot for the study and to me if you completed the [questionnaire](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6VB95SZ?fbclid=IwAR00v-fs0wkfCOwwExgQRcy_MX39hLdjWM6jLA0Voj4skRNwwJxhvPafXDs) and also sent it to the other person in your grandchild-grandparent pair!  

Feel free to pm if you have any questions!"

My name is Mayra, I am a nutrition student at the University of Glasgow. I wanted to share with you my research study survey, since me and my research team are investigating what are the people's knowledge in the UK on seaweed as a food, awareness of health benefits/risks and if there is a growing interest in seaweed consumption.

Seaweeds are very typical in Japanese diets (e.g. in miso soups and in sushi), and also popular in other Asian countries. However, quite rare in Western diets (there are some exceptions in some Atlantic coastal communities) .

I would be so interested in hearing your opinions on this topic , and it would contribute a lot towards my research having some local participants from our neighbor city, Edinburg :) 

This survey could be of particular interest for people interested in health, plant based food and sustainability. That said, everyone is more than welcome to fill it in, and I would be so grateful to you for taking the time and helping me with my research!

Let me know if you have any questions by pm or in the comments section.

Thanks for reading this far ✨💛 have a great eve!

To take part you must be 18+ and live in the UK. The survey takes 20-30 min. And in rewards for taking the time to complete it, you'll enter a ruffle with the chance to win a £50 voucher! I will post the survey link on the comments section."

I've cobbled together a load of old parts for purposes of teaching my mate's kid all about building his own PC. This is going well, and we've got the rig assembled and up and running, but the problem we have is that it's painfully slow and only capable of running Win7x86 because the only DDR3 I've been able to find is a lone 1GB stick. So, I'm here under one of my throwaways in the hope of mooching any old modules from a kind stranger.

Regarding the RAM itself, it's for an i5-2320 / (IIRC) B75-based rig with four slots, so the only requirements are that it's 1066 or 1333MHz, and desktop-size. Beyond that, I'm not fussy. If it's been sat at the back of a drawer for the last five years and only *might* work, that's fine. This whole project is as much about teaching the kid how to think in terms of ""this might work or it might not, how can we find out which and why?"" as it is to give him a new toy to play with, so I'll happily take any old stick. 

If anyone's got anything, please let me know. I'm happy to collect,  or meet somewhere. 

 Cheers."

(put it simply this degree allows me to work at any pharmacy; dispense prescriptions; etc without the need of a pharmaceutical bachelor) since it’s a bit more practical (did not attend University or require 3 years of studies) would it be accepted/ recognized in the UK ? 
I’ve been looking online and on the Portuguese side of things I find no information about it. I wonder if any pharmacist/ pharmacy dispenser that visits this page would know anything about the subject? 
Thank you"

I'll be moving to Edinburgh next month for work, all the way from Chile, along with my wife and 5 year old son. I've been going crazy for the past few months trying to research the best places to live, and I'm struggling to decide on a good spot. If you guys and gals could give me any advice, I'd really appreciate it!

* Budget: ideally around £1000 pcm, so that the total with Council Tax + Utilities doesn't go beyond £1350/1400 pcm
* House is preferred, so we can have a yard -- here in Chile we've been in an apartment for 8 months, in lockdown, with a 5 year old. It's been a challenge, and we'd like to have some breathing room for him if we must stay inside.
* My work is near Holyrood, smack down in central Edinburgh and at the foot of Arthur's Seat. I am ok with commuting there, hopefully no longer than 45 minutes.
* Good primary schools nearby are a must, as you may imagine.

We are not party people, and we'd like a family friendly place, but close to amenities/shops/restaurants so we can have \*some\* social life

I am in search of somebody who could cut a heel for a pair of custom built roller skates. I am not sure of the wood but something that would be slightly flexible.

So I have been looking after my hair during this Covid crisis and been doing an... *Okay* job. Like many other people I decided to go blonde and honestly it doesn't look too bad but my hair is looking a little sad recently and needs the hands of someone gifted, who has been there and will not *visibly* judge me (nothing worse than a hairdresser who tut tuts.)

Now here's the twist. I have afro textured hair. Not quite Diana Ross, but definitely not Meghan Markle. 

I need a hairdresser WHO KNOWS AND LOVES HAIR.
In my experience I have encountered people who are scared to do my hair (not experienced enough), or their expertise lies slightly outside what I want (they focus on braiding and weaves). This is not to cast shade on Edinburgh's hairdressers, I just haven't found the right one, which is why I'm looking to save some time, money and bad hair cuts!

I can't say I have the nicest stuff...Would anyone really take second hand plates from Sainsbury's/Next that are scuffed? Or just random candle holders, cushions and things...

Been learning more about Scotland/England over the past year for a creative endeavor and beginning to realize Edinburgh might be a nice place to relocate. 

I’m burned out on America for a variety of reasons and I’ve lived my entire life in Michigan (which I’ve heard is similar to the Island of England in many ways.) Seems like a good transition. College educated with some experience in marketing/video production. 

Here’s what I planned on offering to get my foot in the door (post coronavirus)—Scotland wants a stand alone film production industry. Read about it in an article so it must be true. I can be your Stanley Kubrick—I’m American—this kind of useless skill comes naturally to us.

Seems like 90% of inventors/scientist/smarties in history were of Scottish decent, that’s part of the allure I’m sure. So what are the negatives of someone like myself jumping ship and coming to Edinburgh? There have to be negatives, I’m sure. I can’t rationalize away the negatives until I know about them.

Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:
1)Took a pretty hard hit thanks to Harry Potter. Don’t worry—I hate that franchise. I’ve got a two-point plan to start reversing the damage caused by Rowling.
2)Employment. That’s a tricky one here in America—land of the worlds most productive workers. Hence why I’m planning to building a Edinllywood (don’t worry that’s just a working title.)
3)Women. Would be nice to start a family someday. 
4)Weather. Don’t worry—I’ve spent over 30 years living through ‘lake effect’ every winter. Doubt there’s anything Scotland can throw at me I haven’t already experienced. 

What else am I overlooking?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about moving to the suburbs. The places I consider are: Bonnyrig,  Ersbank, Dalkeith ( because it's close to the train that gets you to Edinburgh) as Well as South Queenferry.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I am choosing moving to the suburbs is the properties are way cheaper there and I could afford a house or flat with a garden and this is something I really want as I want to grow my own veggies in the glasshouse, have bigger bathroom where I could install small sauna which I love etc. I am tired of renting and have enough money to pay deposit for 50 % of property value at the moment. With my budget I could only find the house with a garden in Edinburgh in very dodgy places, not in Stockbridge or Morningside (I won't mention these places as some of you that live there may get offended. I don't mean anything bad but let's be honest, there are safer and less safer places in Edinburgh, cleaner and less cleaner just like anywhere else in the world :) )

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem is I don't know these places at all. For the Last 10 years I've been living in Stockbridge. I'm a bit scared I won't have good access to the gym, swimming pool, good supermarkets, petrol stations open 24/7 if you need to pop in to buy a chocolate at 2 am :) etc. Would you be able to advise which of these places would be best for me? I am a 30 y.o single male.  What sort of people live in these places? Mostly elderlies or families with children? Are there many singles there?  Are these mostly Scottish areas or places with a lot of expats? 

I know I could go there myself to explore but neither the weather nor Covid19 encourages to that. I would appreciate your opinions and advice :)"

Thing is I’m a student, early 2019 I was in halls and thus exempt, then late 2019 I was in a full student flat and should also have been exempt.

This year I am also in a student-only flat and thus never at any point in time should I have paid council tax. I already went through the Council’s online CT exemption form and they said they would issue me a new bill for £0, which still hasn’t happened.

Now since this is from Scott and Co and not from the actual council, and also for a year that has already gone by and in which I was 100% always in halls or in a full student flat, I’m very skeptical about having to pay this.

I’ve tried calling them many times the past month and they said I’m not liable to anything but here we are."

I just wanted to reach out to express one of my struggles, just to see if anyone is in the same situation or if anyone has any advice.

My current situation: I am a young professional who moved to Edinburgh in 2019, I am working full time and in the meantime, I am doing some courses as well - so most of the time I used to be out, finding myself being either at work or school or in between them commuting haha.

Until I managed to get my main needs sorted (housing, car, utilities) I found myself in the middle of COVID 19, so I moved to a new city and I barely met anyone new, except of my partner. This was a very unusual situation for me to be in because I always knew myself being in the middle of everything and most of the times being out and about in the office or in the school in the earlier times - talking with people, smiling laughing and now I found that I don’t really have any friends located geographically close to me - so then I wondered? Is It only myself? What did change? Is something different about Edinburgh? I remember I read one comment from a lady who was saying that he made more friends in 6 months in Glasgow than in 6 years in Edinburgh?

Conclusions are:

-my workplace is a small firm, everyone has their own family and they are mainly engaged in family activities
-my course mates are very cold because we are all studying remote and some of them are even located on a different side of the Planet and the nature of the course is very technical, not encouraging social interaction

Questions are:

-any tips?
-anyone in the same boat?

Thanks,"

My Dad was a young police constable during these years and operated from the Police Box in Craigentinny Road, adjacent to the local church.  He was called to the house concerned about an emergency and took charge of the situation and was able to assist in the successful birth of the baby girl.   Apart from the part my Dad played, he recalls that the Mum who gave birth, had either two or three young sons and that she was overjoyed at long last, at now having a lovely daughter.   My Dad, who retired from the Police in 1984, has always deeply regretted not knowing the identity of the family concerned, and would really appreciate if anyone out there can help.  He now lives in Clackmannanshire.  Thank You."

Since Saturday I’ve felt a bit off (none of the symptoms of COVID!) and in conversation with my mum she pointed out that maybe it was the weather at fault.

The EPC is from 2013 so I'm sure the costs are a little out of date, I also know it doesn't include the cost of running tvs/cookers etc.

Sometimes is short and brutal ie goes from looking fine to a pile of toothpicks in a few days, or more often it’s a slow, drawn out affair in which the plant slowly gets sicker looking for weeks until its done.

While she means well, there is definitely a knowledge gap here that is contributing to the ongoing plant decline. So I was thinking if I could track down a professional plant person, they could come round and give her a few hours of dos and don’ts for each plant etc…

She is also really loves the Botanics, so if the professional plant person worked there it would carry so much more weight etc….

Both are essentially the same price per month (around 700 for one good sized bedroom, a sitting room and separate kitchen), seem in good repair and come fully furnished. They're both around the same distance from where I will be working. They're both located on the first floor facing away from the main street.

Having viewed them virtually I'm slightly more drawn to the Grassmarket flat. However, I'm familiar with the area and know it can get very touristy - that probably wouldn't be a problem right now but I'm looking to be in the flat for at least a year. 

Does anyone have experience living in either of these two areas, if so would you live there again and why/why not?"

I've got a bunch innoculating that will be shipping out in about a week.

I have king, grey or yellow oysters coming. 

They will be fully innoculated,  all you have to do is cut open the bags and then spray and in about a week you'll have fresh gourmet mushrooms.

If you would like to preorder one I'm selling them for £19 or 2 for £35, just give me a message.

I'm doing free delivery by bike in edinburgh but £4 outwith.

Usually each section has a separate small party then we all come together and do a few drinks. This seems untenable at the moment.

Last post was taken down due to a false DMCA takedown request (for copyright infringement) so re-posting to combat these companies.

So I have been recently applying for jobs and got an offer from Venture 100. Ever since a bad experience with a company called The Hive Collective in Glasgow back in 2018, I have been very cautious about job offerings. Especially ones that come too easy, from companies with minimal information available on them.

Initially I felt skeptical when I researched into Venture 100, but sat through a small 10 minute(ish) interview today with their Managing Director Matthew Vella. After the interview, I saw some similarities in how Matthew Vella not only presenting himself, but his questions, and avoidance of my own questions with that of Matthew Stewart.

Matthew Stewart owns and operates (currently) Omada Corp aka OGC Holdings, previously known as The Hive Collective. Turns out Matthew Stewart and Matthew Vella are connected on LinkedIN, and not only that, Matthew Vella recommends Matthew Stewart for various skills.

How does NXT Wave fit in? I found a photograph (thanks to an Edinburgh Live article) with Matthew Vella and NXT Wave's owner (and a bunch of other people).

It seems all these companies are linked and have the same business model of using people's labour and time for minimal (if any) ROI for the individual.

Common claims these companies make:

· Base salary per year in adverts

· Training schemes

· Uncapped earning potential

· Running your own team in a matter on months/up to a year

My experience is that the reality is much different, usually only commissioned based work (in terms of my experience with The Hive Collective). I have compiled a source list where I found all the connecting information.

TLDR; consider all the information available when engaging with Venture 100. Due to its connection to companies like The Hive Collective, Omada Corp, NXT Wave.

Please also avoid the use of slander, or anything that can be deemed defamation in the comments. We need to keep this post up and avoid getting silenced by any legal tricks these companies usually employ.

Moved to Edinburgh 7 years ago from Canada and am looking for reccommendations of a good jeweller for a few different things. I've tried to do some online research but everything seems quite varied and different to Canada/the jewellers my parents have used for years. 

Things I'm looking for:

\- To get my engagement ring re-sized; it's just slightly too loose, I've been to 2 jewellers (1 high street one not) who quoted me 2 very different prices, £30 (high st) and £50(independent). I'd like to know what the average cost for sizing down a ring is if anyone knows. Not 100% sure of the karat quality of my gold band either, I'm fairly confident its 18K but my dad bought it in the 80s for my mom and doesn't remember any of the details about it. 

\- To get my jewellery collection appraised for insurance. Some high streets store websites say it costs 10% of the value of the collection to get appraised (which seems quite high to me?), the non-high street jewellers said it was 1% of the total value, so again what's the average/standard here? I don't have a huge or very valuable collection dripping with diamonds but I also don't get paid enough to fork out a few hundred pounds for an appraisal. 

\- To have a wedding band made for myself and possibly my fiance, I'd like something to match the style of my engagement ring so not a standard gold band. 

Ultimately I'm looking for something similar to what my parents have at home, a good jeweller that is their go to and doesn't charge them out the nose for stuff. I'm not expecting anything for free or cheap I just really don't know the first thing about the market over here. 

Any help is appreciated, thank you!"

Hey everyone, I'm sorry if room adverts aren't welcomed here, but due to SpareRoom's early bird thing I'm finding myself in a bit of a pickle to find a new flatmate soon!

I have secured a beautiful, fully furnished 2 bedroom flat in Morningside, with the rent being split between the rooms at 600 each per calendar month. The place has just finished renovations, and we would be the first people to move into the place.

It's energy efficient (thanks to double glazing, a brand new combi boiler and gas central heating, including an accurate thermostat!) so the bills are minimal, maybe 20 pounds per month.

Additionally, there is a security system and all new white goods which include a washer/dryer, fridge/freezer, and even a dishwasher :-)

There is a full video tour of the flat, which I recorded when I viewed it the other day. For this, please refer to my Spareroom ad [here](https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/midlothian/morningside/15538444) or the convenient youtube link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvwUHT4erKI&amp;feature=emb_logo)

The landlord accepts people on benefits as well. I would only ask that you either be exempt from council tax, or be able and willing to pay it in full.

I’m a guitarist living in Dalry - have all my own gear with a head/cabinet/pedals etc. Prefer if you had your own gear etc and we can work out the specifics for writing/jamming if I find anyone interested enough that is!

I’m primarily wanting to keep it a 2 Piece with myself doing vocals and playing guitar. Bonus points if you’re a drummer that can yell/growl coz I’d like to incorporate a good mix of vocal duties. 

Realise this is a slim margin for Edinburgh but having a hard time finding anyone haha.

First of all, I would like to apologise if this post breaks any rules, if it does, please, feel free to delete it.

I am a 4th year student at Heriot-Watt, and as part of my last year dissertation, I need to conduct a survey. 
The title of my survey is ""CIGARETTE-SMOKING STATUS, MEMORY AND DECISION-MAKING."".
I need both smokers and non smokers participants, but so far, despite sharing my survey anywhere I could think of, I am not getting many participants and I am expensively growing desperate and paranoid that I won't get enough participants to be able to have proper data.

I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to maybe participate in my study and help the stressed-out student that I am.

The survey shouldn't take longer than 15/20mn, you can participate if you are aged between 18 and 30, and if you NOT had any traumatic brain injuries that might have affected mental skills.
You can find my survey [here.](https://hwsml.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3JbmicjZtoRi61f)

Again, I apologise if this breaks any rules and thank you for your consideration."

www.surf.scot/scotregen/the-edinburgh-12-strategy


The above article was published in November 2015. I have listed the ""Edinburgh 12"" below:


Dewar Place, Donaldson’s College, Edinburgh St James, Former Royal High School, Fountainbridge, India Buildings, 8-20 King’s Stables Road, New Waverley, Quartermile, Shrubhill, 3-8 St Andrew Square, and The Haymarket Edinburgh.


As Edinburgh St James is currently in the headlines, in recent weeks it was the Former Royal High School and not that long ago the controversy over India Buildings I thought it would be interesting to have a 5 year review and temperature check of how people think the CEC ""Edinburgh 12"" approach to strategic city centre gap sites has played out in reality.

What are your thoughts on the ""Edinburgh 12"" either individually or collectively?

Is it what the city needed then or now?

Hits or misses?"

7. Reopening of Warriston Road to traffic
8. Pavement widening and an uphill cycle lane on Broughton Street;

This one theoretically has a shared garden, but you know how those are - realistically, whoever has the ground floor access to it ""has"" the garden, especially in this building.

I always see so many gardens around Edinburgh (around Gorgie/Dalry/Slateford/Stenhouse for me mainly) which aren't being used much, and its fair, not everyone likes to garden or wants to grow things. I want to grow fruits/vegetables, and just wish I had a sunlit green patch to do it on, and I'm on the allotment waiting list, but its at least two years for me!

Is anyone interested in setting up some kind of garden share, where I can grow things in your garden space and we make a wee arrangement about it? Maybe I'd grow veg and you take half of them, so I get to use the space and you get some fresh food out of it? and we could discuss what you'd like to have growing there? I don't have many gardening tools, but we could arrange that, and of course we'd set up some safe agreed way for me to come do the actual gardening, say once a week.

Let me know if you'd be interested, or know someone who might be! I'm in Gorgie-Dalry, so ideally not someone in Leith or Mussie that'll take me ages to get to, but its no rush given the time of year. would mainly want to have this set up to go from March 21 onward."

Sifting through google is utterly soul crushing, it's as exhausting as a flea market where you get stall after stall of the same product shoved down your throat, only to discover that they don't provide to your area or it's the fault of your building for being old and therefore somehow a hostile environment for routers.

I'm burned the fuck out. I need advice on who the best internet providers in Edinburgh are, our definitions of ""best"" might differ so here's what I mean-

-Customer service. I've just kaiboshed my deal with Virgin after 5 days. They sent us a router that apparently had trouble reaching the other end of the flat. (Again, I live in Granton. It's hardly millionaires row. My flat is small... and its 2020. If you can get good quality wifi aboard an aeroplane, then I know for a fact that's it's possible to get good wifi in a building significantly younger than Edinburgh Castle) when I tried to phone, they never answered. I ended up having to cancel by phoning their sales team (funny how they've always someone available at a phone when it comes to taking your money)

- Decent internet signal. I dont expect miracles, I dont even care about fibre optic and all that but again, it's 2020. I know that even the bog standard basic internet is now of pretty good quality compared to the days of endless buffering in 2010. When I worked on cruise ships last year I managed to torrent two series of Rick and Morty and a load of movies using the wifi of a tiny cafe in Tonga. The building next door was a corrugated iron shack. Edinburgh has no excuse for not having internet.

I'm not planning to be doing seamless Zoom calls as I do a multi city conference working from home (that was a wee joke, I'm a furloughed barman) I use Netflix, streaming sites, occasional torrents and porn. I'm the most standard internet user.

- Less than £30 a month. I get it, higher speeds are more expensive, and if you want a package that includes television and phone and seamlessly connecting all your family devices into one package and parental controls and adjrhcidjdhdhdhd FUCK THAT. I just want the internet. Unfettered access to unlimited internet at a reasonable speed, not ludicrous speed, should cost £30 a month. Tops. 

Sorry I know it's a big rant, I'm just broken. I'm not going through the rigmarole of dealing with another monolithic company who don't answer their phones and whose employees you have to threaten with recording the conversation if you want them to do their job. Any help will be repaid with a crisp, virtual high five."

I did a search and all the results are at least 3 years old, if not more!

This is my first xmas in Edinburgh and I'm looking at getting a real tree. I used to live quite rural in England, so getting a 7' tree without reserving one was super easy. I'd go to one farm, walk round a huge barn full of trees and pick the one I want, before they wrapped it up and I went on my way.

I've done some searching and most places in the city seem to focus on tree delivery, with the nicer ones being in west lothian or Fife. I don't want to buy a tree blind, I want to see it stood up before I buy it ideally, unless someone can recommend somewhere that has always been good quality.

Due to the covid rules, and wanting to get a tree the first weekend in December (5/6th) it's not likely I'll be able to drive outside of the city to go have a look.

I'm also fond of the Fraser Fir, which seems to be a rarity here, it's all Nordmann's or Spruces. I'll settle for a nordmann if needs be.

What’s the current state of things in Edinburgh like? I understand it’s masks everywhere, restaurants close early, are bars and pubs closed too?

I'm a bit confused about the travel rules and would need some guidance. 
I'm originately from an EU country but I've been living in Scotland for about 9 years, currently living in Edinburgh. 
A couple of months ago I bought tickets to visit my family, there are some relatives that i wish i could see before its too late, during Christmas, and to leave on the 5th of December and returning on January.

After i bought the tickets, the new Scotland travel rules were revealed, saying, from my understanding, that you cannot board a plane if you're from a Level 3 or level 4 region, as it is Edinburgh is currently in a level 3 zone. 
I was hoping to get more clarification on the situation up until now, as it's not so clear to me, or to see if Edinburgh will move to level 2.

My question is : with the current situation, is it illegal for me to travel during this period or is it only not-advised; I don't want to break the law, but the information is a bit muddy; my flight wasn't cancelled and i don't believe i can get a refund."

I'm curious to know the experiences and time frame of r/Edinburgh people who have had home Covid tests - when you received it, if you posted in a 9am collection, and/or how long you had to wait for the results. It might also be useful info for others here deciding whether to choose a home test.

Over the last few years, Edinburgh has certainly put its stamp on the tech world and is becoming one of the UK’s fastest growing tech ecosystems. Recent reports show that Edinburgh employs more than 48,000 people in the digital tech sector, who make an average salary of £42,500 - almost 15% higher than the overall average salary in the city. Not only this, but 4% of Edinburgh’s working population are active in digital technology, which is only 2% lower than London’s 6%.

To highlight the rapid developments, Edinburgh jobs in digital technology increased over 3 times the UK average between 2014 and 2017, and boasted a £1.14 billion tech business turnover in 2017. Also, taking into account adjusted living costs, the report has also named the Scottish capital the best place in the UK to work as an analyst for spending power, while its neighbouring city, Glasgow, was named the top for Project Managers. With these extremely exciting statistics, Edinburgh is showing no signs of slowing down in its success within the tech sphere.

###HOME OF THE UNICORNS
Edinburgh has been the birthplace of a variety of major multinational companies and unicorns that have gone on to conquer the tech world. Here’s a couple of them that you may recognise:

- Syscanner – this international online travel agency started in a bedroom in Edinburgh and now has 10 offices worldwide with 100 million active monthly users. The CEO, Gareth Williams, attributes the success to the supportive community, world-class computer science department from the University of Edinburgh, and even said if it were founded in an extremely tech-heavy city like Silicon Valley he’s not sure it would have been successful.
- FanDuel – this fantasy sports site started as a news prediction platform that was founded in Edinburgh with around seven employees. The company managed to secure fresh investment and expand globally in the last 10 years, with its two biggest offices still in Edinburgh, where engineers represent the majority employees there."

But that's the ideal case, if you have any job, feel free to contact me, as I'm in need of one. I don't like web agencies like Indeed, and instead prefer to call, message companies, or just create a post here.

I'm very curious, with love for learning and am also honest and hard-worker.

I’m a postgraduate student here but have lived in Edinburgh for nearly five years. For the past few years, I have been thinking about adopting a senior cat to keep me company. However, my lease has stated that I am not allowed to have pets unless I convince the landlord (via letting agency) to get an animal. 

I’ve lived in the property for about a year now and have kept it in great condition. During one of my inspections, the letting agent told me that I was one of the tenants she never worried about in regards to upkeep and care. 

I’m not sure if adopting an older cat would give me more leverage. My intention is to find one that enjoys remaining indoors and is settled down. I have experience caring for animals as well. Other tenants in my building are pet owners as well and have told me that they would be comfortable if I were to get one. I also have money tucked away for any expenses if there were any damages caused by the pet. 

In my home country, I have taken care more than 100 animals as as job, including dogs, cats, turtles, and fish. I have also had pets of my own throughout my entire life. 

The most important thing, though, is whether or not this would be enough to convince my landlord. Any tips?"

Having lived here all my life it seems that the must be a league table of the worst roads in Edinburgh. Never having seen it I decided to make one up myself.

So far at the top of the list is the undisputed champion of them all: **Viewforth**, a street that has the same kind of road surfacing as the runway at Port Stanley shortly after the bombing commenced. Driving down there is an exercise in peril. Even the speed bumps appear to be buggered beyond all credibility. Traffic calming only appears to be enforced by having tank traps dug at selective intervals. I am not sure that *walking* down this road would be any improvement.

I live in an old tenement block in Newington. It's the first winter I've spent in this flat and its beyond freezing. The windows are all original, single-panelled, rotten in the beams and falling to bits. I sublet and am currently skint so have no option to make any major changes myself.

I assume a lot of the older flats in this part of town share similar issues, so I'm wondering how you guys avoid dying of fucking hypothermia nightly in a flat that refuses to retain any heat.

So far I've duck taped the seam between the window and its frame which has helped a little but I still wake up shivering with numb fingertips. Any easy fixes would be massively appreciated.

The crux of the issue is, I'm private and have kinda lost confidence in my dentist. Not such a biggie had I been NHS, but I'm not paying for a dentist I'm not 100% comfortable with that does not communicate with you whatsoever whilst you're in the chair. I've had more information from the 2 emergency dentists I've visited than my own.  I'd feel uncomfortable moving to another dentist within the same surgery, so probably for the best I move."

It’s especially chaotic when the high schoolers get out in the afternoon and play the game of ‘lets see how long we can walk 5 across before we force someone into the muddy grass’. A few times I’ve tried to stand my ground and look straight ahead thinking they’d move a little so I could pass without stepping off the pavement, but one time, thinking they were just taking their time moving out of the way, a high schooler and I practically body slammed each-other trying to stand our ground.

It would be super neat if there were at least a few signs letting people know which side of the path to walk on/ to share the pavement.

With all of my COVID quarantine time, I've taken up some investigative genealogy research to determine the whereabouts of my adopted mother's family.  I recently ran my family through the 23andMe DNA testing service and found out my mother is half scottish and half polish.

She recently got her adoptive birth certificate unsealed from her birthplace, Chicago, Illinois, USA and found out she was born to an unlisted father and Patricia Elizabeth Traynor.  Patricia or Patty, was listed as born in 1938 in Edinburgh Scotland on my mother's birth certificate.  Her address was a homeless shelter when she gave birth to my mother in 1960 in Chicago and she appears to be nonexistent in all other records I've searched with one exception.  I think I found her birth certificate from Edinburgh vital records and it's on order.  It's the only Patricia Elizabeth Traynor born in 1938 in Scotland, so I think it's right unless she lied when she gave birth to my mother.  


In the meantime I'm looking for some Traynors or friends of Traynors from Edinburgh to try to give my mother one fucking hell of a Christmas present.  Do you have a relative that left the country between 1938 and 1960?  Do you want to help me navigate vital records searches in your home country?

What happened when I went to collect my parcel has left me deeply concerned about the state of the royal mail and their security policies.

To preface this, I have had many a job where the use of ID/DPA is a mandatory part of it so I am au fait with standard processes on confirming addresses/Identification/security information. 

When I arrived at the collection office at the gyle I had with me the red collection letter (which had my address and my partners name on it) and my drivers license (which also has my address on it). The gentleman at the desk was pleasant and asked to see the collection letter and asked me confirm the address and my partners surname, so far so good on the security checks. When the gentleman came back with the parcel he asked to see the ID, to which I showed my drivers license which has the same address that's on the collection letter and as I can now see, the parcel.

""That's not the right ID mate."" the gentleman stated.

""It's my ID and has the same address as the one on the parcel"" I answered confused.

""Nah mate, you need the ID of the person whose name is on the parcel."" the gentleman said.

""But my ID has the same address? why would I have my partners ID with me?"" I reply just as confused as my first response

""It doesnae matter about the address mate, It the name that matters"" He replied with

At this point the gentleman opened the door and handed me the parcel and said ""Remember the ID next time"" which was really nice of him but I was, to be honest, completely dumbfounded at what he was asking.

""So I have to bring in someone else's ID who lives at the same address as me instead of showing my own?"" I asked to confirm.

""Aye mate.""

Is everyone ok with this being standard procedure there? I'm sure people who read this won't need this explained to them but just in case: You could rob/burgle someone, take someone's ID with a royal mail collection letter and just take whatever package/letter/parcel that is in the persons name without anyway of being caught since the royal mail don't need you to identify themselves. 

It's utter madness and needs to be addressed."

As my title says, I've made a huge mistake.

I rent an Edinburgh new build, that looks like all the other new builds, with those fake wood looking internal doors.

In a state of manic during the first lockdown, I painted two of them with chalk paint. BAD IDEA. I didn't prep the surfaces at all - just painted my shitty paint straight onto the doors and of course it immediately chipped etc.

I've just tried stripping the paint off one of the doors and it's not looking good. I think I need to replace 2 doors in my flat.

(I'm wanting to move out next year and I can't leave it like this!!!)

What would you do??? Or how do i find a seller who will sell these kinds of doors direct to a consumer and not someone who's planning their new build?

Gigs were non-existent and the clubbing scene was all just cheesy and commercial instead of of proper house, DnB nights etc. I work in quite a “young” industry too, but people here seem to have very different interests from Newcastle, like they were older in maturity than their age.

As an outsider, I am lost because while some media often portray and *rumours* have it Glasgow people speak with a challenging thick accent, I have met and seen many videos by young pupils from schools like Glasgow Academy/High School of Glasgow/Kevinside/Jordanhill all speak with an *ordinary* English accent which I have absolutely no problem comprehending.

You know how to guide me to give me beautiful moments, and to meet beautiful peoples. You know me very well.

Edinburgh,
When I'm with you, you're killing my daemons and you make me forget that they exists.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid to be alone, I'm not afraid to meet new peoples, because you guide me.

Edinburgh, 
You gave me so much memories that I'll never forget. 
You created all bests moments of my life.
In all your pubs, with all those good peoples...

My name is Daniel, a student. I make zines in my free time cause I have a lot of opinions and not many people to discuss them with, but in any case, I think independent publishing of any sort is a vital aspect of the culture of a community, as well as a contribution to the world, so I would like to propose an independent publishing resource-sharing group. This would remove barriers to entry for anyone interested in independent publishing, not limited to zines or other forms of written publication. I have microphones and audio editing software, all sorts of pens, and paper, etc. It also holds the potential to create a formalized DIY community for the University and the city. I have grand dreams, usually spoiled by reality, but I think this is a good idea. I spelled it all out in a notion page, so have a read if you're interested.

With amazon this should not be an issue but I feel like 'free delivery' is priced into the product.

Although we have had many positive interactions with neighbours re our puppy the other day one resident came out and told me, without so much as an introduction, that they were bringing a legal case about to convict the dog owners in the close which we would now be included in (they are not actually in our close but I guess this is moot). I didn't get any detail from them re what this legal case was. 

I am not so much interested in personal judgements on whether my dog should or shouldn't be using the green as I appreciate there are strong opinions to be found on either side of this. Instead, I was wondering whether there are any legal grounds anyone knew of for cases on this? The deeds are very vague regarding use of the green, although access rights are clear, and my understanding of the dog fouling act was that so long as you pick up after yourself, you are fine. Pets using shared gardens seems to be a recurring issue but it's hard to find concrete information about rights and responsibilities."

I'm a mature student, living with my partner in a rented flat. Last week during my online chemistry exam a lot of noise kicked off in the stair. Knocked on the door of the upstairs neighbour, was told it was her 21st, they were just having some fun and her son was away. Tried to reason with them to stay in the flat and out the stairs and was told very aggressively to fuck off and it was my choice to work etc by the sister of the tenant. Called the police who were there from about 3 till 6, back up was called and it was just chaos. Fines were issued because of the house party but that's not fixed the issue. Contacted my letting agency was told it was a PSL flat and we both lodged a complaint with the housing association. Three other flats in the building complained but its only going as first warning.

Since Saturday I've been deadlocked out of the main stair after going to the shops and there's been people coming in and out of the building going into that flat most days.

Just been woken up last night at about 1:30AM by someone repeatedly ringing my door. Opened the window to 3 large drunk men. Asked who they were and one said he's the father of the tenants child and sub letting a room. Obviously got abuse off them when I said it was just supposed to be her in the flat, not him and all his friends. As I was calling the police and they ran away. Reported it again to the housing association but there's no proof this time because I don't have an incident number from the police having to attend.

I'd leave but there's nothing suitable on the market because its Christmas. I'm scared of these people coming in the stair and won't leave the house unaccompanied.

Has anyone else had anything like this or can just offer any advice? Does anyone know if these PSL flats can be sub letted? I just feel like I've stepped into some weird alternate reality this past week and I don't think I can handle this while working next year. I've worked non stop for months and just wanted to catch up on sleep and time with my partner but instead I've been an emotional mess the past week."

But the London life isn’t really for us and we thought Scotland would be a nice place for me and my parents work and a good place to live in since we have always wanted to live there. (Preferably 1-2 hours away from Edinburgh)

I have visited once a few years ago and I loved it, I obviously plan to visit a few more times with family and stay for a while before making a decision, but I was wondering if anyone who has lived there for a while has anything to say about how life would be as a person of colour there. I’m sure it’ll probably be the same as London (so perfectly normal) but whenever I google it there’s always videos on YouTube with the title: ‘Being *Certain ethnic minority* in Scotland’ with a list of things they experienced and some of them worry me a bit. I know there is racism anywhere and I don’t really care anymore, but I’d just like to start afresh with my family and relax especially as my parents are retiring In 10-15 years too.

I have just moved to the UK and I'm looking to buy following a period in New Zealand where I got hit hard buying a property in a market that I did not understand.  I lost a lot of money because I wasn't looking at the things that locals knew to look out for and so I'm looking for advice on what to look out for when purchasing in the UK.

In New Zealand I'd guess that 95% of properties have the same weatherboard, timber frame construction whereas in the UK you have a lot of stone and timber &amp; brick, so what should I be looking out for?

For example I recently looked at a property that looked great but had a lot of rust stains on the slate roof.  I thought it might have been rusting nails but on further investigation it looks more like cheap, Spanish slate was used that had a high pyrite content that rusts out over time.  I'm trying to avoid mistakes like that!

I remember one viewing where there was a literal race to the get the deposit in first. I know a friend who used to carry the deposit in cash in his back pocket in case they would take it then and there to make sure he got the flat he wanted.  


So I was living in a place roughly 2015-2018, and when I went to get a new place after that's when I noticed there was a lot more emphasis on the landlord (usually via the agency) looking at your application and deciding. And the barrier seemed a bit higher for earning for them to consider you but maybe I had just been lucky with that before.  


Now I've always thought it's because they changed the rules considering renting and now you can't be tied to a contract and can leave any rental property with due notice. So the agencies in turn need to find tenants who will be the kind of people who are going to stay there a long time.   


Which I find a little bit unsettling because you can't really judge a tenant on anything except their occupation, age, gender, name, income that goes above and beyond if you can pay the rent and bills comfortably etc. Real basic stuff I'd consider discrimination. It's not like the landlord has a drink with you and finds your an alright person and you're not going to put a hole in the wall and skip the country.  


And if so it means it's one of those well meaning laws that backfires completely and makes it harder on the people it was meant to support. I'd probably rather contracts stayed and there was more support for tenants if the landlord hasn't upheld their side of the deal. Like you can leave in the first 3 months if you say the landlords sold you a turkey and it costs the landlord more to challenge that than its worth.  


So just wondering if anybody else found the same thing, or maybe experienced something that blows my theory to shreds."

My partner and I are both chefs and as you can imagine, the industry is not having a great time.
Our place has closed the doors for good so even when this second wee lockdown is over, there's absolutely no guarantee we'll be working again.

We're looking to help out caring for pets - as far as we know, a lot of shelters are overwhelmed and I'm sure there's a few pet owners out there who can't care for their pets in these times.

We've read up on all the organisations, but quite a few have long term requirements such as at least fostering one pet a year and being involved in activism and fundraising and other things which pretty much require a permanent home.
We cannot commit to this as we travel a lot in our profession under normal circumstances, and likely will again when things calm down.

We'll have so much time on our hands for the next couple of months, and we'd just like to help out.

If anyone has experience with fostering or has any ideas how to go about this, we'd appreciate it.

Before anyone says to contact the organisations, we're asking here first so as not to waste their limited time under covid restrictions.

Thank you in advance."

We just recently relocated permanently to Edinburgh (all the way from Chile). I honestly really miss driving -- I've been driving since I was 18 and I'm 37, it feels weird not having a car!

Because I'm from Chile, my license is not exchangeable for a UK one, so in 6 months I'll have to do all the courses and apply for the local one, but I am allowed to drive here for a year on my foreign license. Seeing as Uber isn't exactly cheap, it's starting to become a bit obvious to me that buying a car might be more cost effective in the short, mid AND long run. So I wanted to tell you guys what I've been looking at and reading, and maybe you will tell me if I'm missing some key points somewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

* What are good/cheap/reliable brands to buy here in the UK, that get plenty of access to spares in case shit hits the fan? There's some brands here that I've never even dealt with back home, and also some premium brands (BMW, Mercedes) that in Chile would be something a rich person buys, that here are affordable -- especially used.
* What's a reasonable mileage per year in the UK? Should I look at cars that have over 120k miles on their clock? Is that safe here?
* Even with my foreign license, I will need to get an insurance. I've been using [Compare The Market](https://www.comparethemarket.com/car-insurance/) and found out that I may be paying anywhere from £600 to £750 a year on insurance for a used car in the £2000 to £3500 range. Is this ok and/or reasonable? Any advice on this?
* I'm looking for cars on Gumtree, FB and AutoTrader. So far, I've seen a lot of dealerships posting, and they promise the sun and the moon to get a sale I suppose (that's car salesmen everywhere). I've personally never bought a used car before, but I've gone through several checklists to check things like MOT (also read through its history to see how many miles per year the car has done, when it failed why it did so, etc.), and I know to look for things like rust, fluids, leaks, milk under caps, etc. The question here: is there anything else I'd need to look for? Any other red herrings that I may not be considering? Any tips?
* Any other advice for first time buyers in Edinburgh, specially foreign buyers? As I said I've been driving all of my adult life, and it feels weird to feel like a newbie again.

I'd appreciate any advice anyone can give!"

We are a group of student flatmates, all around 20 years old, living together in the Marchmont area of Edinburgh looking to start training BJJ full time. But with no access to a gym and relatively little experience how do we do this ?

We have kitted out our flat in mats, got the bjj fanatics vids, mentors to virtually coach us, we are simply lacking from rolling partners.

We currently have 4 members who can roll on the daily, but need more. 

If you are on the same boat as us and want to train more Jiu-Jitsu, give me a message, we can use as much help as we can get.

If you are a more experienced practitioner who could give us some tips, that would be excellent, or if you are relatively new aswell that would also be amazing.

 f you are interested please message me and we can get rolling !!!"

I am thinking about going back to university to study Medicine, but I need to get high school qualifications in Chemistry, Biology and Maths/Physics. Specifically:

* SQA Highers: AAAAB by end of S5 and BB at Advanced Higher.
* A Levels: AAA.
* IB: 37 points with 766 at HL.

I have a BA and MA already in Social Sciences, so I would be a mature student and I do not think I would be given an exception as Law and Politics will not help with high school natural sciences sadly.

So my question is, does anyone know of any high schools in the city which allow online study for either SQA, A Levels, or IB? I have found lots of places to study in person, but online seems a bit difficult. I am a British citizen based in the EU, so it needs to be online (plus, I don't really want to study together with 16/17 year olds as I am almost 30). 

The reason I am posting in the Edinburgh page is because I would like to apply for Edinburgh University's Medicine programme. I would, of course, be open to studying ""anywhere"" online in Scotland, but I thought maybe a big city would have more options. 

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance."

Just wanted to ask about how your end of tenancy experience has been with DJ Alexander.

We thoroughly cleaned the property and despite this we have been told that it is substandard and we will be charged fully for cleaning the property. I've been in correspondence with DJ Alexander and they have sent me images apparently proving the existence of hairs and marks and dust which, call me blind, are abjectly not there. They also claim we have put nails in the wall which were there when we moved in and detailed on our inventory which they now claim they don't have!
Furthermore the property was not properly cleaned before I moved in 3 years ago at all: lots of animal hair as well as dirty marks to walls and surfaces as well as substantial make up stains to the walls and carpet in each bedroom.
They claim to have no record of me complaining of this upon move in.

Has anyone had to contact safe deposit Scotland with regards to returning their deposit when dealing with DJ Alexander?

Thanks

Scott"

WALES: a 3:5 flag adopted in 1959 and in use since 1485; white and green represent the House of Tudor being the House of Henry VII, the first King to bring the flag in battle, the red dragon of Cadwaladr, King of Gwynedd, has been recorded in use in 829 AD but it is believed to have been the battle standard of King Arthur and dates back to Celtic times.

SCOTLAND: a 3:5 flag adopted probably in 1542, if not earlier; known as St. Andrew’s Cross or the Saltire, being the first recorded flag with a saltire on it, for centuries the type of blue to be used has not been fixed as it was dyed using natural plants varying from sky blue to navy blue."

There is so little information online and the whole situation is making me incredibly anxious, so I thought I would ask here. I've not been out of my house for days so there isn't the problem of having been in contact with loads of people. Is education still an essential reason for travel? I would assume so, but again there is so little information online, and what I do find is conflicting.

Alternatively, has anyone had any experience recently travelling to Edinburgh on LNER? Like do they ask why you're travelling or anything? I guess that's what I'm most worried about!

""A decision on controversial plans for new student accommodation beside the Union Canal has been taken out of the hands of councillors and will now be made by the Scottish Government.

The proposals for a 74-bed development in Lower Gilmore Place, Fountainbridge, were due to be considered at a special hearing by the council’s development control sub-committee, but Glencairn Properties, the company behind the scheme, has now short-circuited the process by going to appeal straight away.

Officials had recommended the plans – submitted to the council in July 2020 – should be approved at a meeting of the sub-committee in November, but a decision was deferred – a delay Glencairn claim was unreasonable and unjustified, prompting their appeal.

Residents are objecting to the proposals, claiming there is already an over-supply of student accommodation in the area, and they say they are unhappy the decision will now be taken by people with no direct knowledge of the neighbourhood.

Ishbel McFarlane, of the Gilmore Place Lochrin Residents Association, said: ""At the committee they didn’t have a copy of the residents association or Tollcross community council submissions. That’s partly why there was going to be a hearing, because the council wanted to hear what the local people said. There were 83 objections and only one letter of support – why would they not want to look at it in more detail?

“Now the council is not getting a chance even to ask the developer what he is doing, far less allowing us to make a presentation to the council. It’s just being completely swept away from under us and once again it’s out to an external third party who will be parachuted in.

This will be the third appeal over the site in four years. A plan for offices and flats was rejected on appeal in 2018, then last year Glencairn won an appeal for a four-storey block of 20 flats. But the company switched the proposal to student accommodation, saying the residential scheme did not stack up financially.

Glencairn say the student accommodation is almost identical in scale, massing, footprint and design to the flats proposal for which they won permission.

Tollcross community council has objected to the plans, saying there are already 6,500 student beds in 33 developments within 15 minutes walk of the site.”"

I live in a 2nd floor tenement flat and would like permanent window boxes installed under the windows looking out into the back garden. Since I live in a listed building, planning permission is required as stated under ""Other Additions"" in the council's ""Guidance for Householders"" and I intend on applying for it and respecting the council's decision.

Does anyone here have prior experience with applying for window box planning permission? As I live on the 2nd floor, I'm not sure this is something I could do myself. Are there any businesses you would recommend?

Just wondering if anyone knows any decent sites that advertise Private lets (non-agency), or if anyone knows anyone in the EH16 area who is looking for some renters! Tried Gumtree but its horrendous, the amount of scammers on there so now open to suggestions. 

Looking to rent but not keen at all on agency based lettings due to previous experiences putting us off when we were students (a while back now but these experiences stay with you)!

Anyway in the event that someone comes across this post is actually looking for renters, i’ve popped our info below!


- Unfurnished 2/3 bed property
- EH16 area
- Date of entry: Mid February 

About us:
- 2 (29, 30) + 3 year old Golden Lab
- both previous renters and also property owners so we know how to take care of our property.
- Welcome to visit our current home to show how well we keep it (I know this is very important).
- Both professionals working from home and in EH16 area.
- Selling our current home but our next home won’t be built until August 2021 at the earliest so need somewhere to rent in the interim."

We are all **doing overtime**, because the company does not give us the actual contract hour we are doing, basically for having us working every single day with no holidays, no sick pay and no rights.

I figure now is a good point in my life to seriously start putting effort into my career, fresh start and all that. I have an undergrad degree in English, and while literature brings me joy it does not bring me money. I've tried to come to grips with this for a while, and I just don't think it's worth it for me right now to get a postgrad in this field.


I spent a lot of time after I graduated working with kids--toddlers specifically. I loved the work, but again it seems that my options are somewhat limited, though less than prospects in writing, and to be honest I wasn't so jazzed on the pay. Plus, I plan to raise kids someday and the idea of raising kids at work to then raise kids at home doesn't bring feelings of eagerness.


So, my point. I'm now considering a career in cyber security (haven't nailed it down further than that, though I know there are specialties) but I don't really know where to start. Cyber security has for a while been a minor interest of mine, though I have no real knowledge of it as of now. However, I've done some reading on here and I've seen quite a few positive words about the tech industry in Edinburgh.


Here's what I think are my options: 


1. Do something, anything that doesn't make me miserable, until my fiancee finishes school, and then enter school myself for a degree related to security. Seems like an okay idea to me as the pay in tech, from what I've checked online and in comments here, is generally quite good and would satisfy me for the style of living I'd like while paying off my loans. I think this is my preferred option, as I really enjoy school and the environment around it. 


2. Work as above, but instead of going to school myself I'd save up for certification courses, take and pass them, and then try to wedge myself into the field. This option seems quite daunting to me.


3. Find some kind of entry level IT job, work there for a while while self-teaching in my off time, and then proceed to advance through the field through certs and whatnot. Probably my 2nd choice as of now.


Can anyone provide their thoughts or experiences? Am I being foolish in jumping paths? Is it even possible with my background?"

Im seriously thinking about moving to Edinburgh as the city is amazing, there is only one thing putting me away and is the sun light.

My question is how much sun do you guys really get in Spring, Summer and Autumn? What proportion of sunny vs grey days per week do you have during those months? 
I am pretty fine with the cold and wind, but the lack of sun really affects me.

Our family will be moving over, hopefully, mid to late spring this upcoming year. My husband’s job is in Edinburgh. We are trying to research areas/neighborhoods within and around the city that are family friendly, access to good schools, and easier access to outdoor activities. Also would like advice for areas around Edinburgh that may fit this as well (we are willing to commute, but also looking to start with a rental, and I haven’t seen as many rental options outside of the city).

Second, if anyone has information comparing US style of education to education in Scotland, that would be helpful. Our kids will be attending public schools, and are still very young, but wonder how the transition would be, and what are the main differences. Our kids have been in remote schooling all year...so I feel like they have missed out a lot and worry if they could be behind. 

Thanks all!"

All donations are strictly for helping regenerate the Scottish forests (now only 2% of its original stature) and protect native animals. Thank you very much for your kindness, every donation no matter how small helps loads:))

I chose the charity ""Trees for Life"" as I have always been very concerned about the global impact of climate change and I wanted to help make a difference to this issue in the best way I could. Scottish forests now only span 2% of there original stature and 'Trees for Life' plans on helping to regenerate the Scottish forests and to help conserve and reintroduce native Scottish wildlife. So I decided to get a group of close friends together to trek with me trek across the Scottish highlands, for the conservation of wilderness in the Scottish highlands. Please help me make my dream of global (Scottish in this instance) wildlife conservation a reality!

Now my own experience (as a tenant) with letting agents has ranged from bad to terrible, so: what are Edinburgh's best (least bad?) letting agents? Interested in both tenants' &amp; landlords' perspectives.

Also: are there any places where one can specifically advertise a property to prospective tenants with pets? I have a cat (who will be moving with me), and am happy to let to tenants with a cat or dog, but don't know if there's a specific way to reach them beyond the usual property websites?"

Avoid ESPC Lettings at all costs!!! I’ve been very patient with them and after 2 weeks of not getting my refund for £200 I decided to write this review. In my initial conversation with one of their agents after seeing their virtual tour I asked to pay £200 in order to see the flat in person. During that conversation I’ve said that we would like to move in on 1st of February on which she replied that they could arrange that if our application is successful. So when I told her that I will notify my current landlord that we will be moving out in February she agreed to that. I sent £200 to the agency that same day. I waited for them send the application and when I called them 2 days later they told me that I CANNOT see the flat in person until 13th of February ?!?!?!?! When I explained what the initial conversation was all about they apologized for miss communication ?!?!?! Well, I thought to myself - What a joke and thank God there are other letting agencies in Edinburgh, so immediately requested a refund of my money since they lied to us and that I’m no longer interested in the flat mentioned above. They said it’s fine, they apologized again and assured me that refund will take up to 2 business day. That was two Thursdays ago. Since then I’ve called them 3 times asking for my refund. Last Thursday one of their agents said on the phone that she will make sure personally that money issued back very same day and guaranteed that by Tuesday morning most definitely it will land on my account (What the hell?!?!? Didn’t the previous two conversations ended with them sending money or she just realized that nobody issued by that point?!?!?). Today I called them two times and since they didn’t pick up the phone I left a voicemail. Now, one hour later I’m extremely mad since nobody called back and I have no other options left then to shame them on Reddit for providing a freaking nightmare of a customer experience. I’ve lived in many different countries in western Europe and United States and I’ve NEVER experienced something like this. I hope that money will be refunded to me but the stress they caused by behaving this way is something they can’t get me back. I wish them all the best and I hope the market will judge on their unprofessional way of dealing with potential client.

*Processing img hf4m2dkjjod61...*

Unusually for a grease van, they were both run by Thai proprietors and seemed to sell exactly the same fare, including some questionable Pad Thai and Thai Red Curry alongside the usual grease van staples.

Intrigued, I did some spikkin' with the lady owner of the smaller van, (Thai Grease War Van #1). Apparently the enterprising scoundrel of a chap she used to employ got his own much larger van (Thai Grease War Van #2) and parked it across the road from her. Cheeky! Now they don't speak and just compete to see who has the loudest generator (it's him).

Anyway, both van's have oodles of character**\*** and I highly recommend checking them out. At peak times the chap in Van #2 is quite the sight to watch as he effortlessly manages multiple concurrent orders on the grill while giving you some patter.

p.s. I casually collect Edinburgh greasy spoons and vans on [www.greasemap.me](https://www.greasemap.me) If you know of any good ones, write a few intriguing lines about them here and I'll sling them on.

We've still not actually had our deductions sent to us and I received an email tonigh saying due to the pandemic apparently some works are taking longer to organise apparently.

I was hoping someone that has been through this (and having a look, it does seem a fair few have!) Can tell me roughly what I'm looking at.

Generally the check out report seemed ok. We had cleaners in and everything, barring a couple things which I've already emailed contesting about, was marked as cleaned to a professional standard. 

Some other things highlighted on the checkout report have been explicitly marked as 'tenant charge' which I'm expecting but there's other things like 'marks on wall - recommend landlord repaints'. Are these type of things something that we'll also get charged for even though it doesn't actually say tenant charge? Or is this the aorta thing that would count as fair wear and tear? There's even a couple things that have been marked as 'landlord charge'.  So not really sure what to expect other than just fearing the worst tbh.

Greetings from r/Glasgow.

Just before [Christmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/jy9c6m/local_businesses_shops_for_christmas/) I created a website to list the best local shops selling online so that more locals could easily find small businesses who would deliver to them.

Many continue to be closed due to lockdown and I've had a few thousand visitors find local businesses through the site. 

I've just launched the newest version of the site: [https://small99.co.uk/local/](https://small99.co.uk/local/)

 Other sites like this I've found are paid membership things or not very comprehensive listing *any* small business, rather than those that have an online shop. 

I'm now starting to add Edinburgh based businesses but I don't know the area as well and could do with some help. 

If you know of a great local / small businesses who sell online - please could you submit them [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3tcRLNNQ7pl9SQ-sZKcLqs5OMYM8HH1h28t22WBaWFppTlQ/viewform) and I'll get them listed ASAP.  Please share with friends and family or business owners! Would be great to see it expand beyond Glasgow and know that small businesses are getting some support throughout lockdown.

**TL;DR: Please submit your favourite local shops that sell online** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3tcRLNNQ7pl9SQ-sZKcLqs5OMYM8HH1h28t22WBaWFppTlQ/viewform) **so they can be more easily found and I can send them traffic and sales.**"

Although I can live here decently (as my own space is fine) but I do not imagine myself living here for long and I'm not entirely happy here.

Currently we live in a small 2 bed flat near Fort Kinnaird (5 mins walk) and looking to move to a bigger place (at least 3 bed + study/home office) and dedicated parking / driveway  in the next year or so. I work in the city centre (wfh atm) while wife works near the pentlands (commutes by car).  


We don't mind living in a flat as long as there is proper parking although will prefer a house with a garden and driveway. Budget is around 400k.. we have these places in mind so far:  


\- Musselburgh  
\- Eskbank   
\- Currie  
\- Balerno  
\- Juniper Green  
\- Fairemilehead  
\- Buckstone  
\- Swanston  


Do you guys reckon these places are nice and in the budget? Also are these family friendly / have decent primary schools around?  


Thanks,

I (23F) have an opportunity to move to Edinburgh from Newcastle later this year with my partner (25M). We have been there before and I always liked it more than Newcastle, despite living in Newcastle for the last 4 years. I'm considering all the pros and cons of staying in Newcastle or going to Edinburgh and would like some opinions as to which city people prefer and why? For context, Edinburgh felt a lot more welcome to us and better scenery, people also seemed nicer and there seems to be a lot more diversity of cultures in Edinburgh.

So far the only things keeping us here are:

1. Having to start over with jobs just to live 2 hours further from where we are
2. Rent prices seem to be a lot cheaper in Newcastle compared to Edinburgh (We have 2 dogs so we need a house with a garden)
3. Not sure of job opportunities in Edinburgh compared to Newcastle (I'd say Newcastle is pretty good for it)

Perhaps there are people here that lived in both or have more knowledge on what it's actually like living in Edinburgh for us to make a final decision if its worth it? Thanks in advance y'all!"

Is it ""Salt and Vinegar"", or ""Salt and Sauce""? We know it's a regional thing, with most sources pointing to Edinburgh being the epicentre of ""Salt and Sauce"", but where *exactly* does that region of influence end? Is it Bathgate? Armadale? Blackridge? Stirling? Alloa?

There are different opinions based on whom you ask and what sources you read. For example:

* The [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-scotland-51193539) think that ""Salt and Sauce"" is primarily an Edinburgh thing, with most exports of ""Brown sauce"" going east of Shotts.
* 5PM conducted a survey [here](https://blog.5pm.co.uk/2017/06/slat-and-sauce) in 2017 that gave us some answers but didn't map exactly where the language boundary lies geographically.
* [Edinburgh News](https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/shocking-secret-edinburghs-chippy-sauce-revealed-104357) say it's ""very much an Edinburgh thing and not more of a national thing.""

If you want to help get to the bottom of this debacle, we made a survey [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkUwtvKDNg-p0PyH6JIn_sAvq-IipaDMiq7pGgFMt4bUrJxg/viewform) that should give us a general idea as to where this ""Salt and Sauce"" boundary lies.

We are both from the US and I have a few questions about logistics (especially in the current global pandemic context).

My visa would be sponsored by UoE but how difficult would it be for him to find a position that would sponsor him in Edinburgh, and more importantly, what is the job situation like in Edinburgh in general? He is currently a project manager for a healthcare company in the US and makes about US$70k/year, so I am assuming he'd be able to make the minimum income requirements for the new immigration points system, but I know that 1) he'd likely be facing a big drop in pay to move with me and 2) with Covid and lockdowns, finding any sort of job is going to be more difficult, let alone for someone who is not British or has a visa that allows them to work. (I know getting married solves the visa issue but I'm not willing to do that until I pay off my student loan debt). Any suggestions on websites for job hunting?

In addition, any recommendations on neighborhoods? Looking for something with close shops and restaurants and good access to public transportation but not TOO young or loud, preferably. Would we be able to afford a one bedroom flat on just my salary (assuming he can't find anything immediately) or would we be looking at a room in a shared flat? Are there any expats or women's facebook groups specific to Edinburgh where it might be easy to meet people and make new friends (once Covid is better)? I've lived abroad several times (never in the UK though) but this would be my bf's first time so I want to make this as comfortable and easy for him as possible!

Never really had any problems until the flat beneath me was sold in summer 2018.  The owner's son and his friend moved in and I have regularly complained about the noise.  The son's  friend is an aspiring DJ and would often play music excessively loud.  So loud that I would spend 5mins banging on the door before they could hear it.  All very childish behaviour and I feel like I'm having to act as the parent asking them to keep it down.

I have the father's email address and I have emailed him about the noise and he would apologise and say he would have a word.  A month later it would be forgotten about and back to the usual routine of me banging on the door asking them to stop loud music after 11pm.  Last night I complained at 1am and before Xmas I was down at 3am.

Since the COVID situation I know there has been some parties going on in the flat and again I have complained about the noise.  I emailed the father before Xmas and he explained he is no longer the owner of the flat (even though it has not been up for sale) and didn't want to give me the new owner/landlord details without their approval. He explained that his son no longer lived there, even though he answered the door and apologised for the noise during one of their recent parties.

They are clearly braking lockdown rules and I'm sick of the selfish disregard for noise they are creating.  I go down and complain and they apolgise, but it just repeats.   I know they are having people round and I wouldn't care if they didn't make so much noise.  I have zero sympathy for students who are missing out on nights out.   I have to live and work in my flat right now with nowhere else to go.  Everyone is suffering, not just students.

I emailed the father last night asking him to get the new owner to get in touch to discuss this.  If they fail to do so, then I will pursue this through different channels.

What are my next steps to take this forward?

Do I contact the police and/or the University of both lads to explain the breaking of rules?

Should I contact the council?

Unsure on what I can do - looking for advice.

As I’m getting more and more info regarding wave of protests across the Europe against the lockdown I’d like to read Edinburgher’s (I literally had to google it) opinions on the lockdown and it’s short, medium and long term consequences. I can’t really tell because we have elderly population who tend to fight with me verbally when I’m buying groceries to as why I don’t wear a mask (medical exemption) and on the other hand young people who really don’t give a shit about how many new cases we got or who’s vaccines are better... Please be respectful in the comments and even if you disapprove someone’s perspective offer us an alternative one from your own standpoint. 
My personal opinion is that the world’s ruling elites found a perfect solution to impose full scale surveillance and data control of every citizen along with a big fat excuse to why small shops need to die and big ones to take over while getting subventions from the gov (+ how the fuck the you go back from owing 6,81 trillion of foreign debt [US’s foreign debt] if not by screwing up your opponents in panic ?), thinking there are enough “sheeps” amongst us and very few “shepherds” (who actually use their own brain). Ever since C-19 scam started I didn’t by into that story of Chinese folks from some undeveloped province eating bats to start a worldwide pandemic. And even if that is the case, what the hell did the English eat to start their own version ?! (just a joke, I get that viruses naturally mutate and adapt)...
As far as the consequences I think it’s fair to say that world as we knew before will never come again as there are no guarantees that they will not release new viruses as they please. Now, what honestly shocked me is that entire thing is backfiring against the elites, and as some of you already know there is a community of German doctors who filled a lawsuit against WHO on the international court and it seems like every day more and more people start scratching their head and debunking this crap.
As much as this situation is frustrating and really actually humiliating as well to me/you as human who’s rights were just thrown into river so someone’s grandma (who was already sick) can live through another year or two, leaving their grandkids to have a choice to work either for Amz delivery or warehouse ?!? Damn, that’s really stupid. 
I mean Sweden did it the other way - no lockdown, no drama, no panic and guess what: they had less cases and deaths than UK (percentage wise). So what a duck?! 

When this started I was in denial for many months but now I started adapting and creating ways to earn even larger income as I know that my industry (sales/retail) got sunk pretty fast and will need another decade to recover if not even more.

Another interesting fact is that many of my friends, family members and colleagues have never been healthier as they started eating fruits and vegetables like maniacs. Salute to them and all of you who are healthy in mind and body!

Cheers guys, be respectful."

I also don’t miss the commercial slogans and big corporations being crammed down everyone’s throats and plastered on every surface of the city centre. It seems to get worse every year too. I feel like attending a festival event is only lining the pockets of Richard Branson or Underbelly. 

Expensive food and drink, inflated rent costs, Airbnb occupying vast numbers of flats in Edinburgh, congestion, poor signal, the list goes on really.

The festival needs to be changed back into a legitimate inclusive arts festival, open to everyone. and not a corporate cash cow.

Edinburgh has a big middle class, there’s loads of “old money”, private schools, not many people of colour and things like rugby and classical music seem really popular. It certainly feels like a really conservative place in many ways.

Despite this, nobody seems to vote Tory. There are no Tory MPs and I looked up to see there haven’t been any for decades (even when it looks like they had a small resurgence in Scotland a few years ago). Everyone hates Boris and the Tories it seems.

Don’t get me wrong, this is great. I’m delighted they don’t vote Tory up here, but it seems surprising when you hear all the rugby toffs and people like that. Do people really vote against their own interests like this? Because if they do they are much more decent than in England."

I understand it's an odd request for people to help with but would love people to suggest nice views we can take in as we cruise around the city. 

Lots of Edinburgh is beautiful so it wont be hard at all but it's easier if I can give the driver some idea of direction to take on the day 

Many thanks"

My plan is to hopefully be living there by the end of the year max.

What do you think?

I’ve been looking for an flat to rent - long term- in Edinburgh at the moment, I’m just wanting a wee bit advice in regard to a property I am interested in. Not sure if this is a common thing in Edinburgh or not. 

Obviously viewings and such are not as normal at the moment, but I am a little confused about how it all works as the owner of the property has said it goes through Airbnb.  I would appreciate if anyone has done something similar. 

This is the information she’s given me about how it works: 

“The  Airbnb company requires payment of the first 2 months + a deposit of  GBP650. This is requested at the beginning of the lease and refunded at  the end of the contract (if 30 days notice is given). After these first  2 months, you transfer the monthly rent directly to my personal bank  account.
You must book the first two months through the website. Once  your booking is confirmed, the Airbnb representative will contact you  to arrange the appointment and you can move in immediately.
The  meeting will take place in the flat and he will give you the keys and  sign the contract for the period of your choice (we will conclude a  fixed rental agreement under British law from 2 months up to 10 years).
If  at that point you are not happy with the property, no contract will be  signed and you will be fully refunded the very same day.” 

Could anyone give me any information about the legalities of all this? Just seems a little confusing to me. 
Thank you all 😊"

She lives in Edinburgh and recently lost her pet cat and it’s the first time she’s been cat-less in 20 years. She wanted to adopt but all the shelters are shut because of COVID. She’s really struggling without the companionship so if anyone knows anyone looking to sell kittens or needs a cat rehomed I’d be happy to pay/ come pick up.

But I’m really frustrated with the NHS Lothian recruitment team’s communication or general lack thereof. 

I was recently offered an interview for a reception job at one of the big vaccine centres. It’s not my field but I was excited for the opportunity to help out a bit, and I’ve been unemployed for 7 months now thanks to Covid so I’m happy to support anything that gets us out faster right?

So I get the email saying “Please be available for a 30 minute telephone interview at any point between 9AM and 5PM” (Which, if you ask me is a big ask for any normal person. Shouldn’t they be able to give at least a two hour window? I mean, sure I’m unemployed but that doesn’t mean I’m just sitting around all day every day).

So there I am, sitting around all day waiting for the call. Call comes, I go to pick up the phone, my Bluetooth headphones try to connect because they’re old and don’t quite work the way they should, and the call drops. I try to call back and get a pre-recorded: “We don’t accept incoming calls to this line” sort of message so I immediately send an email explaining what’s happened.

Nothing, total radio silence for over 24 hours now. Should I just assume that because of a two second technological mishap I’m not going to be able to interview? And there is no number to call or human being I can talk to?

Not really looking for advice because I know it’s just a crap situation, but I feel like I’ve just wasted yet another a day of my life and I’m a little frustrated is all. I wouldn’t normally let something like this get to me but given the current situation I saw this job as a sort of lifeline and now it’s just gone.

Anyway. Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy- both mentally and physically. We’ve got to be almost out of it!"

Two that I’d use as examples are Williams and Johnson coffee and the Old Chain Pier. They have used a window to serve through. It reminds me of lots of businesses in Spain or Italy.

Navy blue Samsung S20 FE 5G STOLEN 9pm 06/03/2021

&amp;#x200B;

Doing everything I can to try and get my phone back. Was walking the dogs on the beach last night, put my phone on the wall and walked off (I know, I'm unbelievably annoyed with myself).

Returned 15 minutes later and it had gone. GPS tracked to the banana flats in Leith first thing this morning  it then moved to Granton Medway two hours ago. The battery has now died so unable to track further.

Emergency contact number on the lock screen to arrange return, called it numerous times and though I was feeling hopeful this morning, I'm now resigned to the fact that there is probably no intention of the person handing it in to the police.

Phone is now blacklisted, locked, reported stolen to the police and registered on the Immobilise and report my loss websites.

&amp;#x200B;

Please if anyone sees/hears of one for sale get in touch with me with details. I have the IMEI number and receipt to prove ownership. As usual this is a total nightmare with precious photos, messages and contacts along with the fact it's an expensive phone but hoping everything has backed up fully to the cloud.

If anyone has any other ideas I'm all ears. Totally aware the chances of seeing it again are pretty miniscule  but there's still a tiny bit of me that hopes it will find it's way back.

I've lived in London for the last three years, and my partner was born and raised here. Being Irish myself - Edinburgh seems the perfect happy medium between home and the chaos that is London.

Having accepted a job offer in Edinburgh, we'll be making the move soon enough (however owing to COVID, likely not until after the summer)...

I wanted to know whether any of you have come from London and if so, how you adjusted? By no means am I suggesting that my partner is high maintenance, but I think it's fair to assume that she's accustomed to certain things which in honesty, only really exist in London.

Separate to that, general recommendations surrounding where we (as a mid-twenties couple, who enjoy a quality pint and some nice grub) should go / what we should do, particularly given we'll really be settling in around the winter time, would be appreciated!

I’ve used that card in that exact post office dozens of times but today they seemed to have a problem. Lo and behold, the card didn’t work. So I tried with my credit card, which also didn’t work. 

Then I was really irked because the cashier told me that I was the problem and I’d need to pay in cash. Except, with TSB shut down next door and them refusing to take my cards — by the time I’ve walked to get cash, I may as well buy post stuff elsewhere. The same thing happened to my partner using different cards. Seems like they now want to cherry pick how you pay. 

This feels bizarrely discriminatory to single out specific banks and CCs to reject when it’s still a Visa/MasterCard like any other? What if someone with limited mobility or disability gets rejected like this purely because this post office discriminates against certain banks? 

Anyway, I went to Tesco."

Help me understand something that's happened on 3 separate occasions now:  


I've been interested in a property, called the solicitor as you presumably should do, who's noted interest in the property on my behalf - I'm usually doing this at the first available opportunity, typically the Monday after the first possible viewings, within 3-4 days of the property first being listed.  


...except each and every time, I've heard back within a day that the seller has accepted an offer, without going to closing date, and that's that - the seller never even heard my offer.  


Questions:  
1) Why does the solicitor want me to bother with notes of interest? In what way does this benefit me, as a buyer? Why can't I just smash a bid in straight off the bat? Is this just my solicitor living in the 1990s and assuming things trundle on at the pace they did then?  


2) How are the people putting the accepted offers putting them in? Bypassing the whole solicitor process and contacting the seller directly?

I'm currently studying at Napier University doing an undergraduate dissertation relating to the experiences of UK employees involved in mergers between Small and Medium Businesses.

The reason I've chosen this topic is that its greatly underrepresented in academic literature and I believe that such information could be a great help to both academia and those within SMEs.

The survey should take about 15 minutes to fill out and every question is optional rather than mandatory. I understand that not all the questions can be answered by every employee in a business and that if you're taking time to answer the survey, then I should make it as easy as possible!

Just want to say in advance, if you choose to answer the survey then thank you so much for taking the time to help me out!

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of an odd one here but figured I'd ask you lovely lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Gorgie on Westfield Road in a traditional tenement building (built in the 1890s).  Recently one of the top floor flats in my building was sold for £145k.  It's a large-ish one-bedroom, and from what I saw in the pictures, it seemed a bit bare and in need of decorating but no major renovations.

&amp;#x200B;

I came home last night to find a bunch of posters put up in the stair from Grant Property saying they were doing major work on that flat and would be working for about 6 weeks.

Of course, I started to wonder....why on earth would anyone invest what must amount to tens of thousands of pounds on a flat they already paid £145k for on Westfield Road of all places?  Surely it can't be worth that much on the rental market to justify that kind of investment?

&amp;#x200B;

I looked and saw there are some more student accommodation developments planned nearby, which could in theory mean an increase in property values, but I can't see it having that huge an impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any ideas?"

For a start, it has multiple signs on poles (very professional looking) warning people they risk death for unauthorised access.

There are high quality surveillance cameras all around the parameter. 

There is often a van in 'coconut airways' livery.  It has a web address on the side for this site [here](http://www.coconutairways.com/), which is obviously not a real airline.

The state of repair is extremely high.  The house is well painted and well maintained, and the grounds well looked after.  All blinds are kept permanently closed.

It's location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/AbzEUaTVRxTinvbJA).  If you look closely, you can see the signs at the wall.  This is where the threat of death is made.

If you use Google street view to move around, you will see the high masts used for the CCTV and some other dodgy looking monitoring equipment.

I've always been a bit curious about this house.  It's such a nice place, but literally opposite the runway and a very run down, dilapidated restaurant that is no longer operating. Threatening death to trespassers seems beyond what would be acceptable for a normal, civilian house.  Is it military?  It is spies?  Is it a security company?

I live in Glasgow and didn't realise I didn't have it until I was at the station about to catch my train.

I immediately called the post office explained the situation and luckily, the guy said he had it and would hang onto it for me until Friday when I told him I be back in Edinburgh for work.
Friday comes around and I call him to check they'll be open but he tells me he doesn't have it and can't find it? He says he will ask his colleague over the weekend even though it's the same guy this whole time. I call again after the weekend and he has told me he can't find it. I asked him to check CCTV because someone has clearly stolen it. I call AGAIN the next day and he says he hasn't checked CCTV , he still can't find it and I am 'pressurising' him so ""what else do you want me to do"". 

I obviously know it's my fault I left it. I could have gotten someone to collect it but didn't, since he told me he would keep it for me. Not sure what someone would want with a bag of dirty work clothes and a wee girls present but anyway.... 

Can anyone advise me on the best course of action? Police? Anyone higher than him? He said he is the 'postmaster' and doesn't have anyone higher than him who I can talk to,apparently?"

I stay in a tenement block of 16 flats and my skylight is missing three panes of glass and anytime it rains quite a substantial amount of water will come in through these open windows, as well as through the wood itself, and pool at the bottom of the stairs. I went up to the roof to have a look and could see that the wood is rotten and the panes of glass are lying smashed on the flat roof. I could get quotes for the work to be done but I know that there is absolutely no way that every flat in my stair would pay their fair share and I don't want to be out of pocket.

I was wondering if anyone has had their skylight repaired through Edinburgh Council's emergency repairs service and if so, how much did it cost to have the work done? Trying to work out if I should go through them and get the whole thing replaced or just order a few panes of glass and some flashing and do a bit of a repair job myself.

I really only took this job because I graduated uni right before the pandemic started and then I saw this job which was one of the only few ones advertised and I was desperate so i took it. I have been looking for other jobs but I haven't found anything yet. 

I recently asked to reduce my hours to 30 per week to deal with the stress of the job. I literally do not sleep dreading having to come in the next day. Its horrible the abuse I have to put up with. Anyway, I told my manager that I was struggling with anxiety and couldn't sleep or focus. Which is all true, a family member close to me passed away over the summer and im still dealing with the grief of that, on top of that my mum is severely depressed and has been struggling a lot herself and this also affects my mental health. My HR later got in contact with me and asked me what was going on, I told her what I had been dealing with and she told me to try medication first and that the bank did not have the resources to hire anyone else, that the rest of my team would suffer if I needed to take time off and that I had not been there long enough to request a reduction in hours (by the way, its a high turnover job, so maybe I have only been there 1 year, but at least im still there and im trained on several systems and my stats are good) I was really upset and said I did not feel supported and that she did not understand what I was going through with in my personal life. 

I feel completely exploited by my job and like they are making me feel guilty for needing to take time off. I really can't handle this job at all anymore, but I really need a job. I cannot rely on my family for financial help. 

It does not seem that my request to go part time will be honoured, should I just quit and apply for universal credit or should I stick it out??"

Is any halls fine for getting there or should I try to get one that are close?

Pigbacking on that how is public transport in general? I dont drive but may have my license by the time I head over but would prefer not to get a car. 

What parts of the city are good for nightlife, bars, restaurants etc.. and any spots to avoid?

Finally I'm pretty sure this wont be an issue but is there any anti-Irish sentiment? This is mostly about stuff to do with the Rangers vs Celtic stuff but I know that in Glasgow and mostly in the past anyway.  Is this an issue in Edinburgh?

I have to send a 30 kg (mostly clohtes) to Spain.  I have few questions. 

Firstly I tried  to book directly with no intermediaries but I discovered that they are veeeeeeery expensive (TNT, UPS and FEDEX over £100) and now there are not many companies sending to Spain, Hermes has removed its website for Spain (they used to have [intenational.hermes.com/spain](https://intenational.hermes.com/spain)) and from its drop down menu.

From the parcelforce website a box that weight would be around £90 from an intermediary like parcel2go £20. I ´d rather prefer to avoid parcel2go just in case the parcel gets lost in transit as I would have to deal with the intermediary + the company delivering in Spain.

Does anybody know why overnight Spain has dropped as a destination? I am also concerned about the custom charges the parcel may incur in. My parents are the recipient so basically Im sending this parcel to myself.

Can anybody shed some light into this? Any suggestion would be much appreciated.

I've looked it up and will need council permission but wondering if anyone got some tips on how to go about it. There is for example the possibility to go with an architect but it's a pretty straight forward design of just opening up the middle (2 doors length/weight). so feels a bit steep to pay almost 1000 pounds extra on top of council fee + structural egeener fee + actual work to be done for someone to draw up a few extra plans and submit the application to council. Having said that completely new to this so may be pretty difficult to go without it?

Our neighbour has a shed running down the side of their garden that is probably 5 meters long and probably close to 2.5 meters high.

This thing blocks out light to about half our garden, with the exception of maybe one or two months in the height of summer when it's slightly better because the sun is higher.

They would have room to put it along the bottom edge of their garden, which would be a huge pain for them to move it I'm sure but it's pretty detrimental to our grass and overall enjoyment of the garden. Do we have some kind of rights about this?

I don't think they are in an official breach of any planning issues. But I can't find anything about the light issues on the council website in relation to sheds. If it was a tree then they would be expected not to block light into our garden.

I will speak to them and ask if it is a possibility to move it, we have a reasonably good relationship but I would like to know if there's anything else that they might be in breach of? 

Cheers"

Near the Royal Mile). I believe it was a single-screen cinema, attached to a long run of storefronts, and as far as I recall they exclusively played themed double features and only certain days of the week. So for example, once I saw a double feature of the Hammer horror To the Devil a Daughter and The Wicker Man—several people from the crew of a then-filming Wicker Man sequel were in attendance—and another time I saw a double of Y Tu Mama Tambien and Rudo y Cursi.

I’ve been trying to ages to recall the name of this place and Googling doesn’t really help—if the theater still exists, they make no indication of their previous programming nor does anything come up when I look specifically for places that play double features.

So if anybody, whether you live in the city or have visited, knows the name of this place with any certainty...I’d so appreciate it! Thanks!"

Feel free to delete this if it's not permitted. I'm looking for an old DSI of mine that I think I sold to someone in Edinburgh/this area many years ago now. Probably somewhere between 2015-2017. I have very little recollection of the process as I think it's likely my parents sold/gave it away for me as I was disinterested at the time. I'm now 20 and very interested in the content of that DS!  


If you have a blue DSI XL that looks like this: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Handheld-Console-DSi-XL/dp/B002I0GU2M](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Handheld-Console-DSi-XL/dp/B002I0GU2M) and has flipnote downloaded, I can actually tell if its mine by checking the code in the flipnote app. The code under settings would be 9028C080A0C5A366.

Thank you for anyone who reads this! Have a great day!

The general clauses of the factor documentation state we can make no significant alterations to the property but we haven't seen the nitty gritty details yet, and won't until about a week before completion. By this point it could be several weeks or longer than a month until they can come out and install it, and I'd rather order ahead of time to be installed in the first week after moving in.

I could reach out to the factors and they could say yes or no. But if they're going to say no it might be better to ask for forgiveness later.

Or is installing a new fibre line not classed as as a major alteration? The only thing that concerns me is we've already seen a group communication from the factors regarding hooking the complex up to Openreach FTTH, which makes me think it could be a group organised thing."

So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

I own one property in Edinburgh but due to significant renovation work being carried out, I am living somewhere else where I pay rent. 

The renovation is likely to take months, but as the property is inhabitable (and I mean, it’s just a shell, not walls, no plumbing, no electrics) I was quite confident I didn’t need to pay council tax.

However! I’ve been hit with a bill today (as my name appeared on the land register last week, supposedly) and they ask me to pay council tax in full. I called them, and they said I need to apply for empty property discount for a 10% discount. I was like, what? This property is unliveable to the highest standard of unliveablity. Apparently the previous owner applied for an empty property discount, and somehow that was “used up” for this year, and I can’t apply for that again. I thought council tax was per person, how and why would I be affected by previous owners council tax situation? 

As another note, I am exempt on paying council tax on my rented property because I am a student. 

Any advice?"

I am with a community music charity that helps provide free musical opportunities in North-West Edinburgh. 
I just wanted to let you know that there are plenty of charities out there running events for free. 

The one I work with us running free music lessons for kids, has a community choir, and helps teens create their own music and collaborate to make their bands better. 

We also have a programme on to help kids connect to their surroundings through soundscapes. 

If you'd be interested in joining, or your kids would be interested let me know and I can get you details. 

I'm not going to include our links (not sure the rules on that, and also wish to avoid reddit spammers) 

I'd also encourage anyone looking for mental health resources or just for community interest groups to check out I Thrive Edinburgh, it will help you connect to organizations and resources to help you get back to your best. 
Edinburgh has tons of people willing to help out, we are just having trouble connecting due to the restrictions, so I thought I'd throw this out here to let you know. 

There are music groups, friendship societies, sports groups, cultural celebrations, and just good ole chats and coffee groups. You're great Edinburgh, just keep connecting to one another."

We know most flats are furnished, and one we're looking at comes with nearly everything (including forks/spoons, wall decorations, etc). Given that this seems to be the norm, I'm curious how you make your furnished flat feel like ""home"" as opposed to an AirBnB considering it's full of someone else's stuff? Are you allowed to hang your own pictures/decorations? What if you don't like the style of the furnishings, or they're not suited to your needs? For example, our kids will share a bedroom and will need a crib and single bed, but there is currently a double bed in the room. Additionally, the flat we're looking at comes with some decorative tables and place settings that we're not too keen on, especially with young children. We were told it's up to the landlord to decide if furniture can be removed, and we may have to pay for the storage/insurance of those items.   


This is new to me, because in the US you are generally expected to furnish the entire flat (excluding appliances), meaning each rental is full of your own stuff and can easily feel like home. Any advice/guidance is helpful!"

It looks like one of the hinges broke and the handle came off and instead of repairing they came up with the novel solution of never allowing it to be open again

I've been trying to find someone to come out and take a look and have had response where the guy told me he would just leave it shut because it would be too much hassle to repair.

Can anyone recommend any firms in the Edinburgh/Leith area that might be able to help?"

I was fortunate enough to walk away with a few bruises and a badly damaged bike (getting it sorted currently). For those that been unfortunate enough to have had an accident as such is there a process of informing the council because they got to do something about this.

Got a feeling some people might say “Avoid the lane tram lines are on” so going to answer their question before it’s asked, I’ve done that and you’ll get told off by police and bus drivers for being on the wrong lane therefore the only choice I have is going over them."

From what I've seen there are a number of new builds that are being developed in the area plus the Powderhall Stables are getting revamped, but that doesn't seem like a legitimate reason unless I'm missing something.

Maybe Stockbridge and Morningside are ""full"" and Canonmills looks like the new trendy area to buy a property?, but I haven't seen anything alluring to that.

So I’ve found a room in Edinburgh, someone’s renting me a room in their flat in Drummond Street. I was proper anxious about finding a room as I’m moving up at the start of August  and I just assumed it would be impossible due to the Fringe and lockdown easing up.

So what I’m asking is for recommendations of some quieter (I know August won’t be quiet anywhere) pubs (where on a normal day it’s quiet enough to sit down with a book), restaurants, or places someone who is new to Edinburgh should see apart from the obvious tourist attractions? I plan to live in Edinburgh for at least my planned study time (4-5 years) and hopefully buy a flat if I still like it after that. 

Also any general advice for someone who has never lived in Edinburgh, that would be unique to the city. 

I’m a 28 year old man studying horticulture, into plants, cooking, stand up comedy, natural history and sit-down live music. I’m introverted but like socialising in small doses.

Thanks for reading."

So: what's your favourite bookshop in Edinburgh that you'd recommend to a stranger (and hope is still open)? Can be a wee broom cupboard specialising in pre-owned books, or a massive emporium of new releases - no limits. [I'm a big fan of non-fiction, if that influences your recommendations].

I have emailed them directly with the same questions, I was just wondering if anyone here had experience with this and them, plus I'm well aware it's not in their best interests to let know the cheapest option, but instead upsell me on something more expensive.

**Requirements**

* Cheapest possible option for 2x adults rock climbing at Ratho + racquet sports (tennis/squash/badminton)
* We've no interest in any of the gym, swim, fitness classes, saunas or anything else.

**Known information**

* Fitness membership gives discount card pricing on racquet sports.
* Climbing membership gives unlimited ""free at point of use"" access to climbing.
* Joint climbing membership is £10/month cheaper than 2x singles.

**Assumptions**

There is a lack of information and pricing across venues is inconsistent, so I've had to make a few assumptions.

* No membership includes access to the racquet sports.
* Pricing for racquet sports is on a per-court basis, not a per-person basis
 * So regardless of membership status, you pay the single fee for the court (full or discount) regardless of whether you're playing singles or doubles.

Therefore, if my assumptions are correct, the cheapest option for us would be a joint climbing membership (~£80/month) + single annual discount card (~£35/year) with pay as you go access to racquet sports?"

With lockdown restrictions easing, people starting to return to work and the warmer weather coming in, I’ve noticed on my morning commute, a large uptick in the number of cyclists using the roads. 

While this is great, it’s also quite disheartening to see so many of you disregard the cycle lanes for no apparent reason. 

A great amount of time and money has gone into installing them - particularly over the last year. It can also help the rest of the traffic flow easier if you do use them, thus cutting down emissions. 

So please, use what has been provided to you :)

Thanks."

I was wondering if someone could help me out with dealing with a situation in my flat. 

I live in a tenement block on the first floor where the flat below me is not accessed through the main communal door (it has a funky layout) and I am not sure how the flat below me accesses their flat. There is a door to the communal garden on the ground floor which could be where the owner/occupant gets access but I don’t have a key to get through, and I am flat 1 according to my address. The thing is my flat constantly smells of weed to the point where no diffuser, air freshener or keeping windows open makes the smell go away. 

Is there a way for me to see blueprints of my block so I can see the number/address of the flat below me and who owns it? I want to try and tell them that my flat constantly smells of weed and ask them to cut it out as politely as I can (because it’s technically illegal to smoke weed in flats). If not, are there any methods I can use to get the smell out? Even if it means putting something down on my floors?

Thanks in advance!"

\*Accommodation\*: this is the biggest concern I have. I don't drive and do not plan on buying a car since I am quite comfortable with walking and public transit. If all my classes are going to be at Chrystal MacMillan building and I really want to live in close proximity to a swimming pool (the campus sports center seems not too far from George Square where CM building appears to be), what would be a good neighborhood to explore flats in? I am looking for 1-bed or 2-bed spaces since my husband will join me soon and my mother may visit me. I only need to rent for one year for now since I will have to come back for fieldwork in year 2. Grocery stores nearby would be important too so we don't have to walk a lot with groceries (I am listing all the things I didn't think to consider before moving to the US for my last degree so if things work differently, please do share).

\*Budget\*: From what it seems, I will have 1300 GBP per month. Any advice for financial management? How to budget? Should I prepare to dig into my savings? I have read about Council Tax (but also that students are exempted but also you may have to pay if you live in certain areas??) Which grocery stores are cheaper? Desi folks, would I be able to find spices and ingredients there? Anything you advise I should bring with me from here?

\*Supplies\*: I love thrifting so I am thinking of getting some household items from one of the many thrift stores in the city. Do you recommend? If yes, any particular ones you'd recommend? What is cheaper to bring from here as compared to buying there? Desi international students, do you think I should bring bed linen from home or just purchase there? 

I am sure I will have more questions later but these are the ones on my mind right now. I really appreciate all the support in advance. Thank you!"

Most of the more central areas of Edinburgh and pretty much the entire Southside are well out of our budget so we've been looking at Costorphine, Duddingston, Colinton and D Mains, as well as North Berwick and Dunbar in East Lothian.

But some stuff has been coming up in Cramond lately that has got us thinking. By the sea with some great walks but still within the city limits and on the 41 bus route. Good schools from what we can tell. Lots of good walks nearby. Seems like it could be best of both worlds.

But I don't know that much about it - have only been there for a walk a few times and found it pleasant and quiet, which are selling points. From old Reddit posts I can see folk talking about noise from being on a flight path but not much else. So what's it like to live there?"

I totally get they want to maximise as much space to get recoup as much business as possible, but there was one on the Royal Mile (which I won't name and shame directly) where only a narrow amount of space walk along on the pavement is left and the ""entrance"" into the area had people waiting outside, which left even less space. In fact I'd say it would be a struggle for a wheelchair user to go along and would probably be forced to go onto the setts on the road at busy times. This restaurant has literally taken 90-95% of the pavement.

Perhaps the business is leaving the minimum amount of pavement space (which is pretty narrow) within the council rules, hence I don't want to name them."

We just bought a new flat and we're moving in the middle of June; 

Before we move in properly we want to repaint all the walls in the flat and it's too large to do it ourselves.

The flat has a size of about 1000 sq ft and we want to paint it while it's unfurnished so before we move in.

I was thinking of sending the floor plan and the images of the flat to the contractor plus the colours that we want in each room to get a quote; not entirely sure what to expect, probably between 500-1000 pounds for the whole job and maybe a week of work?

Wanted to ask if you guys know what kind of price to expect, estimated work time and if you have any recommendations for contractors or companies, not looking for something cheap but also nothing high-end.

We haven't hired anyone to paint anything until now so we're unsure of the process, any help is gladly appreciated.

Kind regards,  
George"

Our aggressive and abusive neighbour (who lives in a main door flat) is threatening to change the locks on the front door of our communal stair and we're not really sure what we can do about it  

We live in a tenement in Edinburgh consisting of three main door ground level flats and three 1st floor flats which are accessed via a shared stair. There is a communal courtyard. She (the neighbour) lives in a downstairs main door flat and we live in an upstairs flat accessed via the stair. 

Our neighbour who moved from England last year has been aggressive and abusive on several occasions towards various of us here. This has included mocking my partner for having a mental illness and lots of name calling. She has also shouted at contractors who were engaged to maintain part of the communal are of the property, causing them to walk away from the job half finished. She is seeking access to our communal stair becuase it has access to the shared courtyard and insists that she needs a key for this. We (the owner/occupiers of the upstairs flats) have agreed between ourselves that she should not have one because a) she has a back door into the courtyard directly from her house and b) no other ground floor flat has a key and c) her general behaviour. We have agreed that instead she notify us of requiring access via the stair and we will grant it. Her title deed states that she should have access to the communal stair for maintenance purposes but does not stipulate anything about time frame/whether she has a key.

She is unhappy about this (entirely typically this led to her screaming abuse at me in the street) and has now said that she will change the lock on our communal stair and issue us with keys. We have been explicit that she does not have our consent for this for the reasons above

We have spoken to a locksmith who has said that hypothetically if he were engaged by her he would change the locks on our stair at her request.

We are wondering what if anything we can do about this. We are close to involving the police with regards to her behaviour but haven't done so yet, mainly because we are hoping to move house soon and want to be able to sell our flat. Instead we have been keeping a written record and audio recordings of her behaviour. 

Any advice greatly appreciated."

I got a lot great advice on my last post, about moving to Edinburgh.

After going through all your responses, I dove into research.

And considering all aspects, I realized I missed one important point. My partners job won‘t be close to the centre, it‘s in Roslin. So I started having a look at the surrounding areas. Penicuik seems to be a quite nice little town. Half an hour from Edinburgh centre, beautiful nature in your backyard. It has a ballet school (important for my daughter), riding schools are available too. And it‘s not as expensive as Edinburgh.

The thing that struck me was the makeup: I moved here five years ago and the amount of makeup women here wear was pretty heavy compared to Perth (aus) already but last night was something else. They almost looked deformed, their faces changed that much and a weird colour. Do other people think this or am I just completely out of touch? Is it maybe one of those things like the 80s, where people looked back at the extreme stuff and laughed? Do people here look at my less made up face and think my face looks naked? I’m also wrestling with my reaction to it, because obvs everyone should be able to wear and present how they want, but...honestly it looks weird to me! Maybe it’s just because it was still daylight, I dunno. Maybe I’m just a jealous bitch?"

However, most of the bollards are broken and for the past couple of years I have seen a women blatantly park in all the spaces as her work is nearby and despite repeated notices and stickers on her car she doesn't budge.

1.  She has claimed that she has rented a space which is clearly false as each space is owned by each flat number.
2. She then claimed she has a friend living here but doesn't provide the flat number which again is false as even if her friend lived there she would own one space.

She'll arrive at 6pm to collect her car and then commute home.  Spoken to a few residents who has noticed her and even though we have contacted our factors, they said they can't do anything as the spaces are private property.  There is signage to indicate this but it's not enforced.

Some nut broke my bollard after i installed a new one last year before lockdown so it's meant people like her and other offenders keep taking my private space to my frustration.

Wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what are the legal options I can pursue against this frequent offender.

I searched through this subreddit for similar questions and I have a rough idea about the costs of living in Edinburgh, however as the title suggests I wanted to do a 2021/22 update. 

I am from Eastern Europe myself and in September I will be starting my MA in Edinburgh, so I wanted to know what would be the average living costs for a university student? 

Would you advise me to get a university accommodation or to share a flat with roommates? 

To be honest, I am really a simple and modest person myself. I grew up in a modest family, I can cook meals, I can do my laundry and I'd rather save money for travel than to spend it on luxury gadgets. Point being, I don't need much.

However I will be receiving a monthly stipend of about 1100 GBP and I want to make sure if this will be enough for a normal semi-comfortable life, and perhaps to spare a pound or two and send back to my family.

Thanks a lot"

Moving to this beautiful city in the coming months. I've visited a few times before, but obviously at that stage I hadn't known that I'd end up living there, so it was more important to find a decent whisky bar than scope out accommodation.

I've spoken in depth with friends who either live there now or have done so in the past, and we've decided upon Stockbridge / New Town. It's convenient to everything we'll want / need, and seems there's a huge deal going on.

The issue, however - coming from Ireland, any of the rental sites with which we're familiar are showing really limited options. Is it just that it's difficult to find a 2-bed here, or are we using the wrong sites?

For context, we're after a 2-bed (ideally) with an upper limit of £1,500 pcm (incl. council tax). The sites we've used are Zoopla, Rightmove and CityLets.

Any steer at all is welcomed!"

Why Islington? Minutes away from Central London just without the noise. 

Why a house? I don't like flats.

A bit of background...

The street I live on is practically silent all day, everyday. It honestly feels like no one lives in any of the other houses. But a short 12 minute walk will get you to Angel / Islington where you'll be greeted by the volume of traffic and life again. Angel is where I go mostly for socialising and shopping on a daily basis. Great furniture shops, bars, restaurants etc 

When it comes down to what I prioritise when living is silence and privacy. I treat both as luxuries and will happily pay premium.

So that's why Im here, I need some help and advice on some street gems (fairly central) you may have walked past once that are tucked away from the noise.

I didn't know it was customary to do so here, so of course I'm feeling embarrassed that we haven't done our part. So now I'm wondering about how often people usually clean their stairwells. Is it a weekly thing where flats take turns, or is done more than once a week. For context, it is a 3 story building but the stairs and landings only go up to the 2nd floor."

I think our property manager finally looked into the problem after we thrratened to resolve it ourselves and pay less for our rent. 
All has been fine for one month but then 2 weeks ago when the laundry was on (washing machine is in the kitchen) the water started to overflow from the sink l and flood our kitchen.
I have been emailing and calling the agency for the past 2 weeks now as we've not been able to do any laundry at home and also the sink starts to look like a sewer with all that water.. last week they replied that they will send someone out..same happened yesterday when i called again..we don't know who the landlord of our property is and have only been dealing with the letting agency. As part of the contract the agency should be responsible for fixing this.
Given that it's now been 2 weeks that the situation has not been resolved, do we have any right to pay less for our tenancy since the property isn't functioning as per the agreement? What are our options here?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but here goes. I am US citizen, but the majority of my family live in and around Edinburgh.  I was scheduled to come visit last summer, but of course that didn't happen. So I re-booked my travel to Edinburgh for Aug/Sept. 2021.  Now the time is growing nearer and I have a feeling it's not going to happen again. Right now US is in the amber level which means 10 days quarantine.  What is the outlook? Is there word of this changing? My cousin says that mid June there will be another rule change? Would love to hear opinions.  Thx"

Having lived in a bunch of other places in the UK, when we figured out what the deal was (after trying to work out why we got a ticket) I felt like my brain was melting. How are you meant to know?!? 

As for today’s, we parked pay &amp; display (or on the app, they probably don’t call it pay &amp; display anymore) as we thought the sign covered...the place it was pointing to. My partner’s appealed the ticket and feels like they should at least give him the tenner he spent on parking back, if he’s to pay the fine, citing ‘double jeopardy’ in his anger which made me laugh. I think he’s technically right but don’t think it’s gonna happen. 

Am I the only person who has had to learn about Edinburgh’s mad ‘we don’t have to put a sign up on a single yellow’ bylaw this way, or have other folks had this £30 teachable moment.

The problem is at the moment we can't find any properties that fit our criteria that are available in August, everything is available now, or in June. 


My current lease ends at the end of August (private student accom, so I'm bound by contract and can't get out early) and I can't afford to move any time earlier than that.


I understand the situation where tenants only have to give a months notice of moving out, and this is probably why a lot of properties arent available yet, but it's proving really annoying. 


We are under a lot of parental pressure to get our place sorted for next year ASAP but I literally can't find anything yet. It's quite stressful.


We are not really picky at all, open to most areas and a lot of the flats I see advertised that are available now I would love to live in.

I've next to no knowledge in building etc but decided we need to extend out back a little. Looking for advice as I don't know where to start. Background is we bought house two and a half years ago but now two of us working 9-5's out of it and seems our employers are both minded to keep it that way.

Pre pandemic I'd looked into garden pods and they priced at 7-8k but are now starting at 13k. It seems to me that I could get a fairly high spec conservatory for not a lot more. Pay a bit more again and I could make this a dream home...

Situation is:
Semi detached 3 yrs old
Garden is 7x10m
We have patio doors leading into a... Patio

Can I build up to perimeter so long as it does exceed a certain height?
Are there comprehensive architects that will design and build?

Any help appreciated as I'm all out sea on this one"

Second- landlord didnt give a shit about repairs and things not working, the place was not comfortable for living and had issues with neighbors.
Third/current - street is crazy noisey, i barely sleep, we get about 1 hour of daylight in to our apartment a day, and yet again loud / shitty neighbors.

I have recently been diagnosed as autistic which explains my sensitivity to exterior sounds and noises which has long been a problem. 
We want to find a new apartment but im anxious about moving and yet again being in a noisey place, you have no idea what a place is like to live until your money is sank in it and you're all moved in.

We have been in a sort of modern apartment block and tenement styles, and our budget limits us to around 800, 1000 would be pushing our comfort.

What im hoping for is advice as to what to look for, building types, areas etc.

I have a missus and a 2 year old child. In the past I have lived in Vancouver BC (Canada). I am planning to move from there to Edinburgh owing to its excellent tech industry and still reasonable living cost. My biggest reason to move out from these places are impossibility to buy even a borderline reasonable place to live. I looked into other Canadian cities but that leaves me with Toronto, an equally absurdly priced proposition.  Both cities have almost NO ""on ground"" accommodation available less than GBP 450K-500K suitable for a family (3 bedroom on-ground accommodation with a small garden patch). Thus my motivation for moving to Edinburgh is :

1. Own a living place in or around my work place (possibly in city centre of Edinburgh) for GBP 300K-330K. I need about 3 bedroom and a small garden patch.
2. A relatively mild weather by Canadian standards (I don't want to face -65 degree celcius too often), rain is okay, I have lived in Seattle and Vancouver so I can just ignore rain. Victoria was sunny, I am assuming Edinburgh to be not that sunny but to be warmer than say Calgary in winters.
3. Reasonable presence of tech industry. One or more major tech companies. I know Edinburgh has Amazon and Microsoft presence at least.
4. A decent research university in engineering. I know Univ. of Edinburgh has a pretty good engineering department. Missus is a Phd in Chemical Engineering and possibly will be looking for post-doc positions."

After noticing yesterday's thread regarding making friends in the city, it sounds like there's a lot of folks (including myself) who are looking to socialize and meet some new friends now that lockdowns are winding down, and hopefully staying down.

As a response, I've set up a new Edinburgh Social Discord! [https://discord.gg/3ZscBHfScy](https://discord.gg/3ZscBHfScy)

If you're not familiar, Discord is a modern-day chatroom app. You can find Discord servers for all kinds of communities, interests and hobbies. Edinburgh had / has other servers set up in the past, but they've generally gone inactive or are more specialized around gaming.

Maybe the time's right to give it another shot with a fresh start! It can be a really great way to socialize and chat and get to know folks before going out to meetups with them. The server has a dedicated meetups channel to help organize social events, and there are plenty of other channels to discuss hobbies like books, films, games, politics, etc, or just whatever's on your mind. There's lots more that can be set up there too, like a book club or regular trivia nights, but this should be a good start for now.

I imagine it'll start off small and it may well end up fizzling out like other servers, but after what I saw in yesterday's thread it seems like it's worth a shot!

FYI: Once you join the server, you'll be unable to send messages until you agree to some basic rules around being respectful and being old enough (the server is 18+ only). Just click one of the little role icons based on what area of the city you're from!

Hope you give it a shot. See you there! [https://discord.gg/3ZscBHfScy](https://discord.gg/3ZscBHfScy)"

I was living and studying in Edinburgh with a company called student cribs when coronavirus came along... i had lost my job only a few days before and was in the process of looking for a new one to pay my rent and then that was all sort of thwarted as covid came along. I knew I wouldn’t have the money to pay my rent or even to pay for food so I packed up my room, messaged the company with my notice and moved in with my parents to avoid having to pay my last few months of rent.


However, since then they have been hassling that I have to pay rent until the end of my contract. But I don’t have the money and surely this is a mitigating circumstance. Apparently it’s their policy that any tenant moving out must find their replacement to move in, but given the circumstance there is about a 0% chance of finding someone to move into my old flat.

So, I’m calling on anyone with an understanding of Edinburgh renting law or just the laws to do with renting from a company. I could really use the help, otherwise I’m going to have to get some sort of loan out.

It's over 3 years since I was last flat hunting, trying to do so now, despite much more being on the market and staying on for longer seems a lot harder. Anyone else finding this?

Current issue I'm facing with one letting agent is not being able to view without paying the deposit first - is this the norm across the board? (And that was after making an application and having to get the landlord's approval before I even got to this stage?)

While I can't confirm if there are vulnerable neighbours, it's the first I've heard of someone local getting sick - we live in a pretty tightly knit community which has its own whatsapp group. I guess people usually aren't that vocal about rimming canines though.

I know dog poop is by no means ideal but the communal space we're talking about here isn't Kew Gardens - it's just a crumby overgrown drying green where foxes shag at night.

Also including quality of accommodation, course content, and organization, and especially student support in terms of careers, studying abroad as well as personal tutors/tutorials etc. (since student satisfaction isn't really very high for the uni and it would probably be worse now due to covid/online lectures)

2) Even if you do not go/ used to go to the uni, are there any aspects of Edinburgh that one should know before coming? e.g. places to avoid, places that are safer even at night,  hidden gems, the accent, tips on interacting with the locals, etc?

So basically I’m considering going against the grain and getting a flat while they’re cheap and worrying about a house a few years down the line.

Anyone bought flats in the last few months? Can you give me your assessment of the market, and sell prices vs. valuations?"

I was with trinity lettings and they are proposing that they take £296 of the deposit (roughly 20%). 

Whilst I can appreciate that decorators are in high demand at the moment, my gut instinct is that this ‘fee’ is inflated. 

Worth pointing out I’ve not received an inspection report or a breakdown of this.  I received the figure from safe deposit and I was aware of the issue with scratch by calling them up after handing the keys back. I did take photos before that though."

I'm looking to start a DnD campaign in Edinburgh. I've already posted on the Open Roleplaying Community Forum. But thought I'd cross post here too.

&amp;#x200B;

**The post**

Hi everyone,  


I am looking to run an in person campaign of Icewind Dale RotFM. My girlfriend is the only player so far but we are looking to find two or three other players who could form a party for after lockdown restrictions are lifted. In the meantime we would like to run a session zero on Roll 20 to be sure we would all be a good fit for one another.  


We're in our mid twenties and would be looking to run fortnightly midweek sessions mostly from our cosy flat near the Meadowbank area of Edinburgh.  


I have 1 year experience DMing on Roll 20 running different styles of campaigns for different groups. I have amateur acting experience so I'm open to a heavy roleplaying vibe but I'm more than willing to adjust the style of storytelling depending on how comfortable players are with roleplaying. I have also been slowly building up my collection of miniatures to run the campaign and have enjoyed painting them during lockdown.  


Please drop a message if you're interested.

The music will be extremely loud some nights, with someone shouting down the phone or having loud conversations. 
Talks have been attempted but nothing has worked.

I thought Stewarts, etc would come to my aid, but selling multipacks of cans seems much more common.

Not that bothered about style, but a typical 80/-, or any real ale tbh, would be fine. All the better if there's finings at the bottom! I could collect, but delivery to central/southside Edinburgh would be preferable.

Don't want to hire a pump or any of that nonsense, just a box with a tap where lots of nice beer comes out.

The ferret guy.

The piercing lady.

Mandy (you going out tonight? I'm happy!) 

The techno Viking dude, always wears shorts and argues with no one in particular dude 

And, of course, some who have sadly passed but have left a lasting imprint on the city and its people: 

Tom Gilzean, the most charitable gentleman we ever had 

And (my personal favorite) the crazy grandad who would always zoom about on his electric scooter around the Royal Mile, moaning about tourists and overpriced shops.

It's my fourth year in Edinburgh, before that I lived down south and while I love this city and I'm obsessed with the nature here and architecture I've come to the conclusion that there is a bit of a globalised/capitalist driven culture of perfectionism and transitioning here. 

My reasoning is this: many of us, especially young people, are coming into Edinburgh to study and are excellent students and generally speaking quite competitive. We come here to study, we fall in love with the city and decide to stay, maybe a year or two longer? maybe more? So many of us, talented beautiful people, come here without really an intention of settling and creating a family and it's more to have an experience, build a career or grow in some other areas. Or simply see what happens. Not having family and friends make many of us very focused, very, dare I say, individualistic and I found that to be true both in terms of relationships and friendships with other people transiting through. I found that there is an attitude of ""me"" more than ""us"" because many of us know we'll likely won't stay long-term. Also, not having a support system here means we're more stressed and more likely to be perfectionists in order to keep ourselves going and so have less time to build a community or take responsibilities for others in a way that a community does. 

This is my experience of course and I'm a little bit of an introvert so I'm sure more extroverted people have had an easier time building lasting connections :)"

**We are now looking for recommendations for month-to-month broadband contract providers who can move quickly.  We appreciate any info. FYI, our home has a ready set up for regular broadband so we just need a new router and activation.** 

In short, Sky has continued to have delays and given us wrong information (and been dishonest about survey work which they said had been done when it hadn't) and we don't know when they will actually be able to provide the service. Thank you much for your tips in advance!

Longer version: Sky had said that our home was in their coverage map for fiber optic cable hookup available and the engineer was originally supposed to install it on the 31st of May.  However, he came out and said that it's not possible to use the rear garden access point and that a survey must be conducted to determine whether a box could be installed on the front of the building.  We were then told that the survey had been done and that an engineer would be coming to complete the installation using the new access point on 8 June.  Instead, it turned out that no survey had been conducted and the engineer couldn't do anything.  We don't even know if should even trust Sky anymore and just cancel this process altogether.

This situation is really frustrating as both my wife and I work from home, we do lots of teleconference, and wife is going to resume online teaching from home in the Fall,  thus we need a stronger internet than that provided by a (mobile SIM card based ) hotspot - like what helps us survive currently 🤯😩😫."

I'll break it down as much as I can. (TL'DR at the bottom)

\&gt;We live in a Tax Band D HMO flat

\&gt;2 full-time working adults and one full-time student

\&gt; I (I am a full-time student) had already applied for exemption for council tax

\&gt; I read the council tax information for students and it says if there are two working adults then they receive 100% of the bill

\&gt; there was no agreement when we moved in we would split the tax three ways

\&gt;been living there 5ish months and all of a sudden one of the flatmates wants me to start splitting the council tax so they can save money

\&gt; I disagree because I am exempt and I have no source of income

\&gt;They currently pay £90 per month each. The full total is £180 a month between 2 of them. If we were to split it 3 ways it would be £60 a month each .

\&gt;My argument is that I am not legally obliged to pay council tax and 100% of the liability is on them to pay, the council can not make me pay the bill as I am not jointly liable. Also, I am on considerably less money and can not afford to pay the extra £60 a month

\&gt;for the sake of her saving £30 a month where I would have to take £60 out of my pocket I do not think is fair. I tried to be liberal and justify it, but when they work full time and they spend a lot of money on cocktails, dates, takeaways, and marijuana. I reckon if they wanted to save money they can cut costs by sacrificing some other things.

\&gt;I am open to any ideas I want to solve this I am trying not to be biassed but I am open to discussion about. I just need someone who knows more about council tax and an outside perspective.

\&gt;I've already asked a number of people and they are on my side but we shall see.

TL;DR - Tax Band D HMO flat. 2 adults, one student. One of the adults is trying to make the student split the council tax three ways so they can save money. They work full time and can afford it. I am a skint student. Need advice and an outside perspective."

Profit: £128 - £30 (pitch cost) = £98

Price per minute: 8/40 = 20p a minute (40 mins because of subs)

Price per minute of pitch: (30/12)/60 = 4p a minute (60 minutes full)

3 + games a week: 98\* 3 = £294 +

TLDR: Thats 5x cost price.

We decided to make a separate group, and only approached guys who we personally knew from this WhatsApp group. By this time we had enough players for our own game and charged cost price. We just want to have some fun and not get ripped off!

1 month later (today), someone asks in the original whatsAPP group why the price is so expensive, another finds the pitch cost price, another does the maths and all of a sudden you have dozens of unhappy footballers.

Word gets out of our non for profit group and bang, a revolution kicks in and we receive a barrage of players.

Just thought I'd say how happy I am that we kept our morals and didn't sabotage their group. The guys found out themselves and decided to make a much better life decision. If you're playing 3 times a week, that's £96 a month spent on football. We’ll cut it down to just £36.

TLDR: After doing some maths, we found out we were being ripped off extortionately. We created a side group and the players in the original group self-destructed and joined ours. We'll now offer them a much cheaper price to play the sport we all love."

First of all, thanks to you all so much for your replies. It was really helpful, I read it all. I didn't answer because it's an ongoing issue and I'm a bit overwhelmed.

So now on to the leak: the short story is, the leak is still there and worsening. A new crack appeared in the ceiling. The main door is now affected and harder to close.

The long story: Braemore claimed on the phone yesterday that the tenant is being difficult (not answering, not letting the plumber access the area). Somehow they were waiting on the tenant to give the go ahead, so that the plumber could get entry to the flat. A plumber was there on Thurs (confirmed by a few neighbours), and couldn't access the affected area due to stuff, and the tenant ""refused"" to let them move it, so it was agreed that the tenant was to call when ready. So they told us so over the phone, in different words. They were being quite polite, even friendly. I'm no fool tho and know that talking sweet is the main part of their job.

And we got a hold of the tenant on the wekend, who is a perfectly sound person (didn't interact much with them previously, quite reserved), just working odd hours which is why it's hard to get a hold of them. Turns out, a plumber (may as well be a cowboy ""contractor"", needs confirmed) turned up on Thursday, couldn't access the area, was expected to come back on the Friday. Never showed. Someone is meant to come today, I'm not holding my breath.

Needless to say, someone's lying, either Braemore, the tenant, or the plumber. However, I don't even need to know who it is (got an idea, however...), as it is on Braemore to treat this leak as an emergency. If you saw the piece of wood nailed onto the ceiling, this is a ""fix"" from another leak a few years back. The location is known for having issues already. The ground floor neighbour had to spend good money to get the area damp-proofed (they didn't realise what it was caused by) a few years back. This shit doesn't fly, they are on the hook for all the damages this time. If a tenant is being difficult, they can gain entry with the help of council/polis. A few neighbour homeowners/residents have now become active and it should be straight forward to get legal action if needs be if we turn up in force.

So my next step is a strongly worded letter."

There is a young woman called Hannah who walks up and down Leith walk mostly in the late evening and she is in her early 20s, white, skinny and has brown dreadlocks and she dresses quite hippy/vintage. 

She will go up to people, tell a fake story about how she needs money for accommodation or food etc after running away from an abusive partner and then continuously ask for extra money for other items she 'needs' 

She also gets violent and becomes guilt-tripping if you tell her ""no"" or try to walk past her. 

I've copied part of a status that was posted on a couple of Edinburgh based Facebook pages about her after she scammed them and approached them again another night a few months later.

\-

&gt;""And then yesterday night 12/06/2021 during midnight, my friends are I was celebrating my birthday and were waiting a bit at the bus stop by East Dalry Road when the exact same girl ran into us again, only this time she said that she was homeless and needed some money for food. We recognized her face and told her that she already got money from us the last time and that she scammed us. She first denied that she asked for money, and then became mad, calling us low for not helping her and went away.   
&gt;  
&gt;We called to police to tell them of the incident and it's good that we did because while we were on the phone, she came back with two guys dressed in black yelling at us and to trying to argue. I started filming for evidence and when she realized that I was filming, she got aggressive and tried to grab my phone, pushing me and thankfully two of my friends moved in the way to protect me. But one of the men pulled out a knife and put it next to my friend's chest and threatened us to stop filming. As you can see in the video clip, the scammer woman was not ashamed of scamming us last time. But tried to say that we're bad people trying to disgrace her on camera even though she acknowledged that she lied to us about her stories of being an abuse victim, and scamming us for money saying if she needed the money and we gave it to her, she did nothing wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;But because we called the police, the guys said ""Hanna let's go"" and they ran away towards Haymarket. The police arrived a few minutes later and said they knew of her and went their direction to find her but after 10-15 minutes the police returned saying they couldn't find them. I gave a statement for around 40 minutes and then we finally got back home.""

\-

There were screenshots of her business page and pictures and videos of her posted but I've not linked them. Obviously it goes without saying, she's with some dangerous people and anybody could be hurt from this.

To anybody in Edinburgh, especially Leith, if you see this girl, STAY AWAY FROM HER and DO NOT GIVE HER MONEY!"

And I just had to stop to watch wtf is going on.

And on his final piece, he kissed his thumb and forefinger and waved at the birds before walking off like some PGA tour golfer.

Relocating to Edinburgh at the end of 2021 and looking to rent an apartment/ flat, just my wife and I. Looking around Stockbridge/Comely bank area.

Are there any reputable letting agents you would recommend for Edinburgh in general or even for this area specifically? 

And… anything to look out for? E.g. something you wish you’d known before renting in Edinburgh? I know every city has it’s own rules and requirements of renters and landlords and don’t want any nasty surprises.

Cheers!"

So I went through the initial nhs assessment through my gp and they said it was on the moderate to high scale and wanted to refer me to the full NHS adhd assessment (basically next step) but an appointment will be several months down the line as you would expect.

I’m curious about any reliable private options for assessment that might be nhs friendly in terms of transferring back to nhs after the assessment for the key medications etc.?

Usual private adult assessments go upto 1.5k and I looked at psychiatry UK which seems more reasonable at around 350-500 but not sure if they’ll share patient responsibility for the prescriptions etc. with the nhs.

Has anyone gone through this route and have any recommendations for me?"

None of the owners or agents are taking responsibility and this is just annoying when we are working so hard to make our little shared garden nice.  Is there any legal recourse, do owners have a responsibility to maintain some minimum standards etc and would the council even help enforce any such?
