I've heard a lot of stories from his side of how it used to be. I've been told ""Oh as soon as you get to ****** territory don't be wearing anything of this or that"" ""I don't think it'd be wise to play certain Irish songs at night"" and the answer being our Windows might get bricked in?

I come from a very strict household followed by a move to Sweden and extreme rebellion, which has now petered to a ""treat people how you would like to be treated, don't litter, don't shit where you sleep, karma can bite you in the ass, but most importantly, you mind your business I'll mind my own"" but also equally I won't stand for being bullied or pushed in to something that absolutely insane to me, when I'm minding my own business? (no matter what my odds are) 

I don't want to have to take off my Ireland hat I got from fecking Carroll's just because I'm walking in a certain area?

Are there actually certain groups (and who are they and what's their craic?) ""controlling"" certain areas?

What are they called and what other terminology and do's and don't do I need to know?

And anything else handy? 

Thanks."

New mum has been amazing and was thinking of doing something for herself and possibly her friend who she has barely seen for a number of months. What would you, if you were a new mum, tell your significant other you would like if given the chance? Was thinking of getting some decent food in and cocktail delivery for them whilst her mate's partner and I have the kids, but don't know if that's just a bit meh and lacking in creativity. I would have preferred a wee spa day for them but would love to give her an interim lift until such times as that is possible. Child is about 7 weeks old now and she's recovered well in case that influences any suggestions. 

Thanks in advance.

I've been at this whole music thing for a few years now and decided I would set myself the task of writing a new song everyday this year! So far I have uploaded 173 original songs that I've created in my home studio, with guitar, vocals, bass, drums, keyboards, electronic instruments, ukulele, kazoo, whatever's lying about really....

It's a fairly wide mix of stuff, so far, I'm trying to keep it interesting for myself by doing lots of different styles of music, so there's folk, rock, hip hop, techno, ambient music, all sorts of stuff. I've also been collaborating with other musicians from Belfast on some of the songs.

So anyway, if you fancy listening to any of the music you can hear it all here (for free):

I am not sure where he worked or whether that place still exists. It was some kind of automotive school. But I was hoping to find an old newspaper, a dance hall flyer or maybe a small symbolic token that represents something from his life back home. Before the family moved the house was burned and they lost everything.

Problem being I have no idea where to find such an item. So, I know it’s a stretch, but if anyone has any ideas for a small gift a sentimental token of Belfast it would be greatly appreciated."

I'd like to understand the correct order and learn about any traditions surrounding First Communion vs Confirmation in Irish Catholicism.

Where do children typically take religious studies?  


How long do Confirmation Classes last--is it for a year?   


Do kids ever take Confirmation classes in school, or only through a church?  


 Is a confirmation class optional or expected if you plan to become recognized as a catholic in your community?

What age do you take First Communion vs Confirmation?

Is there anything (classes? Ceremony? Traditions, anything)  that precedes First Communion?   


What about confirmation?

Can you please link me to something that outlines what an Irish Catholic would learn in Confirmation class?

No 1. The town was empty. The amount of premises like the Spaniard &amp; Muriel’s which are boarded up &amp; seemingly, if the chat is correct, are never to return. They have already gone bust.
No 2. The fact that if you want a pint you have to sit outside in the glorious 14 degree Irish summer, freezing your wheels off. Which is great for about an hour and no more. Unlike Europe there’s no patio heaters or blankets to make it bearable for the ladies. It’s a novelty at the moment, that won’t last.
No 3. If you want to sit inside and drink, you have to have food. Don’t get me wrong, I love a feed, but if anyone thinks a city centre bar / restaurant is going to break even on a burger and a pint, they’re gravely mistaken. Inside the bars were empty as very few people were out for a feed.
No 4. A large number of city centre businesses like cafes and coffee shops are sustained by office workers who are currently working from home. My Mrs has been told she won’t be back in the office until JANUARY at the earliest. She works for a city centre company with 500 staff. That’s 500 people no longer buying coffee, sandwiches, business lunches, or going to pubs after work on a Friday.

None of theses four things is sustainable. The city centre, albeit only in the early stages of reopening, is a shell of its former self. Even if tomorrow morning the govt announced a full reopening, there are businesses who no longer want to pay city centre rents who are no longer interested in having thousands of workers in the city centre. So ultimately things are going to change &amp; change significantly. The economic impact of Covid is only just beginning to exert its influence and I fear that most people have no real idea just how far the implications are going to reach."

I’ve decided to give learning how to drive another go. I’m aware this is largely theoretical right now since anything driving related continues to be shut because of coronavirus, but since the guidance notes aren’t the clearest I thought I would chance my luck here...

I am applying for a new provisional license. I threw my last one away years ago when it was long out of date. The application form asks for this to be included if I’m making a renewal. So do I contact the DVLA and ask them to reissue a long expired provisional? Or should I apply as a new applicant? My details have also changed quite a lot since then, including address and change of name by deed poll. 

If anyone can help demystify this for me I would be very grateful."

Have seen a few posts about renting or moving to Belfast, so as a culchie who moved to the “big smoke” and has lived here for 10 odd years, I thought I’d share what I’ve learned.

When I first moved to Belfast in my mid twenties I lived in a house share. At that stage I had few personal possessions, not much money and even fewer responsibilities. I rented a room in a four storey Georgian terrace in south Belfast. If you’re older than 30 and considering this, bear in mind you’re at the mercy of your housemates, so choose wisely! This was party time &amp; the things that went on in that house are the subject of frequent &amp; unwanted flashbacks...
I then grew up a bit, got a better job &amp; while I still enjoyed the cosmopolitan, up and coming, cool coffee shop, litter on the street, will I get mugged going to buy milk vibe, it was time to move on.

I decided to rent an apartment in East Belfast as I thought it was a safer and quieter version of South Belfast, which it most certainly is. I considered the West of the city, but it’s very divided &amp; I struggled to find an area that looked safe and stable. The North doesn’t have great transport links &amp; effectively only one route into the city centre (Antrim road), plus it doesn’t have any of the cafes and bars I came to enjoy in the south, so the east seemed like a good compromise. The east has a couple of nice bars, a good few eateries and decent transport. I’m still here 7 years later and it’s a great place to live in my opinion. I moved into an apartment in a small block on a quiet residential street. Apartments are a nightmare. Good rents get snapped up quickly. 6 month rents don’t exist, so you’re looking at a year minimum. If you’re looking to rent, PropertyPal and PropertyNews are a great place to start. If a listing is up for more that 6 weeks, don’t even waste your time going to view it. It’ll be on that long for a reason, the neighbour is a turd farmer, there’s a nuclear power plant in the garden, etc. etc. My advice is to make a list of your must-haves &amp; be prepared to compromise. There’s an element of luck in viewing early when a good one comes online &amp; snapping it up. Currently there’s a lot of empty Airbnb’s which *appear* to be pushing up the costs of rentals, but it’s just greedy owners sticking their neck out &amp; hoping to attract a tenant with more money than sense. That said, rents are expensive and it’s a landlords market.

Renting gave me the freedom to move out quickly when I needed to, which I was very glad of. I was paying £750 for a one bedroom apartment which was nice, to be fair. But it’s hard to save when paying someone else’s mortgage and then some. My landlord kept my deposit &amp; I had to take him to court to get it back. Some of my neighbours were very noisy &amp; I’m a light sleeper, that’s a terrible combination when there’s a party on a Tuesday night. The purpose of renting was to test out the area and after two years I had saved enough &amp; was happy to buy close by. I’d strongly advise living in an area first before you decide to buy in it.

I’ve seen posters ask how to check if neighbours are ok before you move in. If you pay a bit more for a decent solicitor to do your conveyancing the vendor is *legally obliged* to disclose problems with neighbours or calls to the police. So my advice is pay the extra and get a decent solicitor to check everything out, and don’t be afraid to walk away from the property if all is not right. I found a house, put in a bid and after six months I had my keys. My house is three times the size of my old apartment and my mortgage is £430. I’ve been in this house 6 years and genuinely feel part of the community. It’s a 15 minute walk to the train station which is great for afternoon pints &amp; something to eat at the weekend. I’m beside nice walks and close to the airport, which is good for my jet setting missus who works in London a lot (pre-covid). Renting is a horrible trap to be stuck in &amp; I would never buy an apartment or rent again.

Hope this helps!!"

I was wondering if there was anyone here who knew of any dungeon and dragons players/groups who were interested in some more games or wanted to welcome a new player????
I don’t play D&amp;D - but my older brother (28M) does and I try to take an interest for him. I don’t intend to play but would love to find him some new games and players because I think the games he is in at the minute are winding down/he isn’t enjoying them as much.

McMenamin is not a terrorist. Defending your country from a foreign occupier and an occupying army does not make you a terrorist. By ICE's logic and the Boston Herald's logic, does that mean that the Continental Army were terrorists for attacking British Army barracks? The RUC were not a police force, they were the boot of an apartheid state. They were similar to what the police were like in the Jim Crow South in the US.

We should be honoring McMenamin for being a patriot like George Washington and Francis Marion. America should be a refuge for those who fight for freedom. I hope Ireland gives him a hero's welcome. If it was not for men like McMennamin, we would not have the just peace in Ireland that we have today.

Sadly, the FBI used to train the RUC, and America gives Israel billions of dollars to murder Palestinians, and gives Jewish-Americans who join the Israeli Army and commit war crimes against Palestinians a hero's welcome. SMH.

Here's two articles about him being deported:

I went trough a long really bad phase in live which lastet 7 years and I was so stupid and let my teeth suffer from it, It is 100% my own fault.

I use taxi apps exclusively ( value and Uber ) where I provide pick up and destination addresses . 

Then when I’m in the taxi there is usually 3 stages of questions : 

1 - As soon as I get in the taxi ( after confirming my name )  they first ask where are we going ( I can see the destination on their mobile/gps they have in the dash ) 

2 - Then the next question will be something along the lines of “ how do I get there ? “ ( again I can see the full route already laid out on their mobile/gps ) 

I then explain that I don’t drive so wouldn’t know the roads .

3 - After telling them I don’t drive they just ignore that and continue to ask questions about how to get there , usually along the lines of “ should I take the road through the town or go around “ / “ should I go this way or that way “ or asking for a specific , “ so do I take a right just after X ? “ 

After constantly explaining that I don’t know and don’t drive I get super pissed off. I’m not the taxi driver , it’s literally their job to know this . 

They have no problem finding where I am getting picked up using their mobile / gps , why is the destination suddenly something that I need to be quizzed about ? There is literally a map telling you the best way to go to the destination in front of you. 

Has anyone else experienced a growing trend for stuff like this ? None of my journeys are out of the way , either in Belfast or Lisburn but it’s nearly every taxi I get now !

I cleaned it up, it took maybe 3 weekends of hauling to sort it out (so much of it was intermingled with the soil and knee deep weeds, so not a new problem). Everything was fine after, but then a few cans appeared on the walkway again, which I figured would happen sometime or other. But I woke up this morning to find a row of trash lined up along the walkway. Clearly whoever was used to throwing it into my garden saw it was cleared out and stopped themselves, but now the walkway by the house is becoming a dump. What do I do, clear it myself? Or should I leave it and wait for the pile to grow...

Usually this wouldn't bother me but happening on my door step has jolted me a little. The streets around me fly Union flags and this is new to me, so I don't know if this has anything to do with one side vs the other type of thing or if I'm just thinking too much on a weird event lol.

This is an unusual request, but I’m working on a project that every single one of you can help with (if you want). Info below, and also on my [website](https://www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain).

# What’s the project?

I’m putting together **a collection of photographs taken by the people of UK and Ireland during lockdown.**

These will be printed into a small photo book, as a memory of this strange few months and the many different ways in which lockdown has affected us. Each image will also have a short caption from the contributor, explaining why the image relates to their lockdown experience. The book will be printed later this year, with all profits going to a UK-based mental health charity (specific organisation TBC).

# Who can contribute?

Literally anyone in or from anywhere in the UK/Ireland. You do not need to be into photography, you do not need to have a beautiful image to share or an amazing story to tell. The point is to get submissions from all walks of life. If you have experienced lockdown in the UK/Ireland in some way or another, I would love you to be part of this.

# What do I need?

1. **A photo.** As long as it relates to your experience of lockdown, anything goes. It could be something that brings you joy, or it might be something painful. Your highest high or your lowest low, or somewhere in between. It can be beautifully shot, or just a shitty blurry snap from your phone (this project isn’t about photography skills). It might capture a big cultural moment, or something small and personal, even just something totally mundane. People, objects, places, selfies, pets... anything goes. **It just needs to be related to lockdown, and mean something to you.**
2. **A few words.** To give the image some context, I just need you to let me know what the image is of, and what it means to you. These words will appear next to the image in the book, as a caption. Again, this isn’t an exercise in creative writing, just write whatever comes to mind, and as much or as little as you like. Seriously, three words is fine, three hundred is fine also.

So that’s my ask! Told you it was odd. To submit, or to find out more, I’ve set up a page at [www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain](http://www.lockdownproject.co.uk/britain)

Feel free to ask any questions on here and I’ll definitely get back to you. And please do share this around if you want to - getting the word out is my biggest challenge at the moment!

Thanks so much."

Hope we are all well!!

Was looking for some advise, myself, parter and 1 year old(be 2 by time we move over) are looking to move to Belfast. Love the city. 

We are looking to rent for a bit first but was looking for some help around areas, I've done a bit of research myself but hoping to hear from a few locals. Just looking for a nice area to bring up the wee one and have a decent garden.

Coming from Glasgow I'm not adverse to the divide in Belfast and its not something that really bothers me but its different in Belfast that some communities are segregated still whereas in Glasgow we all just live amongst each other. Although I couldn't give two flying f*cks about  religion, or what religion anyone else is. I have a very Irish Catholic surname and don't really want to bring up the wee one in a community that's mad for the 12th July celebrations. That's about the only thing I want to avoid.

Wouldn't like to spend much more that £800 a month. Would also consider outside of the city with good transport links, shops, schools etc.

Thanks a lot for taking time to read this and hope to hear from you!

Honestly, the other big name shops need to take some responsibility for everything too - some of the things I've seen would make you vomit.  I can say confidently I'll be moving my shopping over to them now..  maybe I shouldn't be saying this because now karen will see it as a challenge to exercise her freedom to infect and cause a scene - so if your that person, go to asda you'll love the company there - if your normal and sane, try Forestside sainsburys..

I was studying video game development there and it was a nightmare. Class was full of people who just weren't great, they were rude but also overly political with everything, they had some thoughts that were genuinely criminal in nature. 

The teachers were fine some good, more terrible. I left with an okay grade of MMP and am going to a uni abroad but I feel like I could have got a higher grade at another place of education. Especially after seeing the lower module grades I got were with the poor teachers while the good teachers got me better grades.

The course was not great either as I was in a game development course expecting to learn about coding, when in fact I only did one class, for 90 minutes about coding, may add the teacher didn't know what he was on about and it showed in my module result, many things in the course make no sense like learning about excel, but not C++. Learn to write movie scripts but don't learn how to code, just made no sense. 

If your thinking of studying at met I must stress you that socialising in the place is close to non, most students are very stuck up their own ass don't care for anyone but themselfs. Alot of ignorant people.

 May also add the school do not care about you as a person, I was there for two years, met some good friends most not in my class or department we all bonded over the issues I've brought up as many have brought up them issues. 

Many I know left the school with issues due to the school as the teachers lie alot, thankfully I am going to uni to do IT but many others left with nothing and it wasn't their fault. 

Just felt like saying this as I had heard others on nights out saying similar stuff and its been on my mind alot as of late"

I've been trying to find out what the actual official rules are but everyone I ask contradicts eachother and no one can point me to a clear answer (for instance on a gov site)

I'm living in portugal at the moment and was hoping I could get back to belfast to spend xmas with my dad since hes been alone now for almost a year. 

I was planning on coming 2 weeks earlier, renting an apartment and self-isolating for 2 weeks before seeing him. Then getting a covid test just to be sure. I'd then plan to stay an additional 2 weeks (at my dads) before returning home. 

During this 1 month in total I would only have contact with my dad. 

Anyone know if this would be allowed?"

I reported the problem to the stores I'd bought from and they've said they'll tell Hermes to investigate but it's likely to take a few days.

As you can tell I'm an Englishwoman thinking about moving to belfast for grad opportunities. I have aunts/uncles/cousins/ in Tyrone but have been raised in the very loud South of England (Brighton) with English parents. 

I was just wondering if it really is that different? Obviously, everything is cheaper but I've only been once so thought id get some insider info on Belfast in particular. 

I can drive in Britain but would I need a different license?  

Any idea of if I'll be allowed in the republic the same as normal NI ers. I'm not sure if I can get an EU passport because of my circumstances.

Also what area would you recommend I move to?  I'm in my early twenties so want to be where the action is! 

I'd love to get back to my 'roots' because  I feel like I'm missing out &amp; really loved it when I went (even though I almost drove into loch erne).

I lived abroad for 6 years between 2012-2018, have been back in NI since.

Since coming back, I've been rather stunned by the number of rude and even sometimes aggressive interactions I've had with people - always unprovoked.

I realise it's hard to quantify and I'm not comparing where I lived (Australia and Canada) with Northern Ireland.

I'm more curious about how people feel things have changed out on the street since the 2000's and early 2010's.

Am I remembering things through rose tinted glasses? Maybe I forgot all the rudeness before?

Should emphasise that I'm not saying everyone here is like that - I am (and always will be) Northern Irish and I know many people are friendly enough. When I was abroad I always boasted about the welcoming nature of the people here.

My theory is that we are pretty welcoming to visitors, but maybe not so kind to each other?

But overall, have things got more tense? People less patient? Has COVID exasperated it?"

Not only has mastermind H.P.

In their illustrious history, Scooter has spent more than 500 weeks in the Singles Charts and 300 weeks in the Album Charts, selling over 30 million units along the way and have achieved over 80 Gold and Platinum records from all over the world.

In 2018, Scooter celebrated their 25th anniversary with a year of shows all over Europe. They played over 50 sold-out dates in front of over 250,000 fans and spent the summer performing at countless festivals including Lollapalooza to Neversea to Budapest Park. However, of course with Scooter, the party doesn’t ever stop and they continue The Sixth Chapter of their illustrious career with the God Save The Rave Tour in 2021.

The song was written by lead singer Peter Gamble who explained:

*“The idea for ‘Live Right Now’ originally came from my wife constantly saying to me “if you want to do anything in life do it now – you never know what’s around the corner. Don’t put things off”, and also the feeling that life was racing by and I was just a spectator running on a hamster wheel, never stopping to enjoy the moment.*

*I guess the idea of making the most of life and enjoying every precious moment has become even more relevant given the situation the world now finds itself in and the uncertain times we are living in”.*

The Undertones emerged from Derry in 1976, the result of five friends (John O’Neill, Damian O’Neill, Feargal Sharkey, Billy Doherty and Michael Bradley) learning how to play basic rock and roll.

Even by the standards of that decade, Derry was not the rock and roll capital of anywhere. With no live bands worth watching, they learned by listening to mail order records, reading one of the few copies of NME that made it to Derry but most of all from listening to John Peel’s wonderful show on BBC Radio One. Practising in their bedrooms eventually led to the band recording John O’Neill’s ‘Teenage Kicks’ in 1978 on Terri Hooley’s Good Vibrations label in Belfast. The legendary DJ John Peel received a copy and liked it so much he played it twice in a row on his radio show.

We were thinking the areas above and to the right so Rugby ave, Fitzroy ave, Hatfield Street, Rutland Street but not sure if they’re any better.

I’ve had people say the holylands isn’t actually too bad to live in if you manage to get a decent house which we can try but it’s just my friend has a car and he’s worried about it being in such a lively area. We’re not too bothered about it being loud and such as we don’t live in the best of areas at the moment anyway lol

Can anyone let us know what they think? Is it possible to even find a nice house in the holylands or surrounding areas or recommend some letting agents?

Thanks a mil"

Just wondering if there is anyone in Whiteabbey who can get Freeview? I have been using Freesat for years because I could only get 10 or so channels on Freeview. The postcode checker always said I could only get a few channels in my area. Someone told me it was to do with the transmitter in Divis/Black mountain. I’ve just checked today and it says I can now get full coverage in my area so was wondering if there is anyone in the Whiteabbey area can confirm? Thanks in advance.

I (24, female) don’t wish them to act either extreme. I wish they would find a happy medium where they showed their interest without making me feel like meat

Was noticing the lack of any real focus on matters regarding BLM/LBGTQ+ concerns in Northern Ireland. Why is that? Why is our country more backwards compared to the likes of England or Scotland? From my personal experience it feels like Northern Irish people do not treat the impact of racist/homophobic hate speech with appropriate concern. One of the best parts of living in this era is how so many people have had a revolution in how they think about the victims of racial/homophobic hate speech. Hence why I really feel this country needs to do A LOT more to improve on such pressing matters. 

Is is 100% imperative that the far right nazis who exist today are eliminated from our society forever. These are the same people who propagate lies and myths about the experiences of People of Colour and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Their actions do so much unnecessary damage to the most vulnerable individuals of our society. Instead of hating on these people, we should be building them up and empowering them through various ways. If we fail in doing so, we risk slipping back into our old bigoted manners. Appropriate contingencies must be created to avoid this from happening!

So, with that in mind, does anyone have any ideas of how we could deal with our country's racist/homophobic elephant in the room? I would personally love to get into politics so I could give the best representation for the unheard voices of Northern Ireland.  (All suggestions welcome).

Thanks fxlks,

So I'm planning to visit Belfast in the late summer or fall if our (global pandemic) situation improves.

The reason why I wanna visit Belfast is because I just finished the book called ""Say Nothing - A Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland""....I'm also currently reading ""Voices From the Grave"" by Ed Moloney. So, guess this makes me a Troubles tourist, as much as I hate the label. 

I understand that modern Belfast is not what it was in the 70's-90's...and I'm so happy for how far you all have come to be since then.

With that said - I'm gonna show my colours here and tell you that, as an individual, I would like to see a united Ireland. A united Ireland is a strong Ireland.

I'm planning to do a political tour of Belfast. I would like to see Bombay Street, Divis Tower and the Falls Road area.

Are there any areas or places you could recommend for me to see which would give me a deeper perspective on the politics of Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole?

I do not mean to offend anyone with this post. I do not know how taboo it is to bring up the history for the troubles, so I apologize in advance if I touched any sensitive chords."

You can read more about the project at** [**www.sounddiplomacy.com/belfast**](http://www.sounddiplomacy.com/belfast)

Belfast is a city with a rich and diverse musical history, and it has recently made a commitment to music, through the designation of the City of Music Steering Group, and a new cultural strategy demonstrating and recognising the value of culture and music to this city. This work with Sound Diplomacy will directly feed into the recovery of the music sector post-COVID-19. Belfast knows that music builds communities up, connects them, fosters equity and promotes fairness. But to ensure that music delivers for all members of the community, a robust set of evidence and data, and a bespoke and actionable strategy with an associated recovery plan are required to guide policymaking, outreach and planning into the future. Sound Diplomacy have committed to delivering this through a wide-ranging, important scope of work for Belfast, including cultural infrastructure mapping and economic impact assessment.

A survey has been launched today to all musicians based in Northern Ireland, music businesses, all relevant stakeholders to the music ecosystem and the general public. To complete the survey please visit [**HERE**](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6159089/Belfast-Survey).

The bands new single ‘You Don’t Own Me’ is out now, taken from their forthcoming second album Who Am I? ahead of its release on February 12 via Dirty Hit.**

*“You Don’t Own Me is a song for women about what it’s like to be a woman in this world. How society depicts, judges and criticises women on a daily basis.” says frontwoman Heather Baron-Gracie “This song is incredibly important to me and I wanted to represent my own experiences. I also wanted to say a f\*ck you to everyone that plays by these fake delusional rules that women and gender need to fit inside a specific box.”*

‘You Don’t Own Me’ follows on from ‘Easy’ – the band’s first single of 2021, premiered on Annie Mac’s Radio 1 show as a Hottest Record and accompanied by an official video that drew influence from gothic-romantics and Tim Burton. In late 2020, Pale Waves returned with their comeback single ‘Change’ and ‘She’s My Religion’ – another deeply personal single for frontwoman Heather Baron-Gracie who wanted to represent a same sex relationship between two women in its true form without hiding behind the cliches of over-sexualisation or playful experimentation.

TLDR at the bottom :) 

Hi hows thing we are United Tribes a Belfast based arts and multimedia collective, we are hoping to open our arts Hub in South Belfast soon and are seeking help some from the public to get us up and running.

So we set up a gofundme page to seek some help :) 
gf.me/u/zigah9

We are trying to get off the ground a new space in Belfast that will cater to new, upcoming and seasoned alternative  artists in Northern Ireland and beyond. 
We are planning to use the space as a place to hold exhibitions, band rehearsal, markets, workshops, small private events, coffee shop, online gigs and general multimedia hub.
Even in these mad times we need something to keep us motivated and forward thinkin, and feel that we'll be able to utilise a space like this in various aspects of what we have planned sooner than we think.
So far we have spoke to the landlord for a great showroom space in a non residential area of South Belfast and got an unexpected and positive response when  we gave him the proposal.

We are asking for donations to help us get us of the ground, pay the deposit, and get the door open ie electricity Internet and general housekeeping stuff to get it ready for all you awesome people.
We are open to donations of any amount but we have set some perk you'll recieve

£10 will get you 
1 year membership 
1 free event/exhibition/work

£20

2 free event/exhibition/workhop
4 free coffees

6 free event/exhibition/workshop

£100
Indefinite membership 
10 free event/exhibition/workshop with plus 1
10 Free coffees per month 
2x4HR use of the space ie rehearsal, run a workshop, market stall be creative :) 

This is a place we feel the alternative scene needs in Belfast somewhere we can freely express ourselves and reach our creative potential or at least put us on the way. 

We are also open to new committee members that are interested in running different areas of our organisation ie promoters, artists, workshop hosts, market traders and general people that would like to use the space to facilitate their creative needs. 
If this is something you'd be interested in helping with please get involved and let's make Belfast weird again :)

TLDR:
Belfast based arts collective seeks help if you can go to our gofundme page and helps us would be amazing :)

I know this is a load of ballix since I was with him when these supposed messages were dated. And knowing him he’d have no shame in admitting if it were him hahaha

I posted on here back last year about moving over to the area with my partner and our daughter, you were all really helpful, thanks a lot for that.

Due to all your suggestions we were able to look and visit areas and we have came up with a good list of areas we would like to stay.

We are looking to rent, we have started to properly look now and it seems the market seems to move really fast!! I have contacted a couple of agents to have a quick chat and the process seems to be an application process that then goes to the landlord to make a decision. Where I am, its pretty much first come, first served as long as you have the money and pass the checks you get the keys. The agents I have spoken to are saying that they have been really busy and get lots of applications, we are not too fussy we are just looking for a nice house with a nice garden and have about £850 to spend, but I can imagine the types of housing we want, there is a big demand......

So was wondering if anyone on here has any fairly recent dealings with letting agencies and have went through the process? Is there any advise you can give to stand out on the application? We are a bit worried that when we apply a landlord will favour people already living in the area to people looking to move into the area if they were to get a load of applications. We would happily sign a longer than 12 month lease from the correct property but that's that only thing we can think of to stand out. Or am I perhaps worrying for nothing and the letting agencies exaggerating a bit, they are all about sales after all!!!

Sorry for going on a bit here!! haha! Thanks again for taking time to read this and any help or advise would be greatly appreciated."

Ravenhill Road

Albert Bridge Road

Conversely it would be a strange thing to say 'The Great Victoria street', or 'The Agincourt Avenue'.

Not uncommon across the UK/Ireland ('The Tottenham court road etc'). If you had to define a logical or historical criteria as to why it would be, what would you say?

Figured it is all to do with historical locations but we also never say 'the Botanic Avenue'. Our split in the debate is that it is either reference to locations or possibly even just major thoroughfares into town."

Edit: I just wanted to update you all that I have taken my dog reading City vets and I have registered them to flynn vets.

I phoned up city vets this morning to cancel his appointment. They asked if I would like another, I told them no and they asked why I said I was taking my dog to a different vet they asked why I told them I just wasn't happy with their service and they asked me to elaborate and I just again said I wasn't happy and the receptionist said oh okay and ended the call.

The original SOLD OUT show date has also now been rescheduled. (All tickets remain valid)**

For over 30 years, Texas has proved themselves to be one of Scotland’s best ever bands and nothing short of a national treasure south of the border. The band recently released their single ‘Hi’ the first to be taken from their brand-new album.

In December 2019 Texas played a sold-out Glasgow show at SWG3, their fastest-selling show ever. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of their acclaimed 1989 debut album ‘Southside’, the band played the entire album. After the overwhelming success of that show, Texas have decided to do the same on their forthcoming tour, coupled with a setlist compiled of songs both old and new.

I'll be heading to Belfast toward September to study for the year. Looking to live in a decent spot. I have student accommodation options available from Queen's but would like to see what the market is like outside of the University, but within a reasonable distance and preferably not in a rough spot for foreigners. Ideally looking to live by myself or one other person for peace and quiet, but that might be a pipe dream given costs, but can't help to aim high!

I ask on the forum as Coronavirus is still with us and creates some level of uncertainty going forward, so any reputable companies or known scammers etc that may be taking advantage of pandemic that might spring to mind, would be of great help if you drop any details below

Any useful info on Belfast accommodation in general is welcome, for that matter.

Thanks!"

So I've recently been offered a place for my postgraduate at QUB (psychology conversion) , I am very torn between choosing here and another uni in England.

Can anyone tell me their experience on how they felt they settled in to Belfast?, did you find the university experience was good?, how did you find meeting people/ the city itself/ nights out ? Any problems with finding accommodation (not student accom as I'll be 24 and don't want to be in a house with a load of undergrads... but still want to be in a place thats good for a bit of craic now and again lol)  


For context I am from the a border county in the south and already know all the craic about the divide between catholics/prods in Belfast so Im not really looking for info about that  


If anyone at all could give me any advice/ share their experience I'd be very very thankful &lt;3

Would appreciate some thoughts. We have rats or mice inside the cavity wall of a small extension. We have been trying nearly a year to get rid. Got pest control out, planted poison traps, some were eaten, and we definitely could smell the death through the walls. We also identified a potential entry point where the neighbours house joins ours, there was a rather large hole under the brick work on their side, and somehow the pests has gotten into our cavity. We have sinced sealed the hole. (I had to go in and do it)   
Our neighbour says they haven't heard them, which is odd since the noise is pretty obvious. We don't get on with them at all, and can imagine if we have to get rentokill out again to deal with this, the discussion on who takes responsibility would be a difficult one.   


So a few questions. Legally who should be dealing with this? Im happy to meet in the middle, as the rats/mice are more annoying than having to pay it all myself but some kind of negotiation would be nice.   


Also, anyone have experience dealing with rats themselves, without professional help? I've bought humane traps and start there, but any pointers are appreciated."

The ‘Out Out Quoing’ Spring Tour in 2022 will stop off at The Waterfront Hall on 27th February and The Olympia Theatre on 28th February.**

In September 2019, QUO performed a triumphant set at the massive Radio 2 ‘Festival in a Day’ event in London’s Hyde Park in front of 65,000 fans. That turned out to be their last UK show as the ‘Backbone’ Winter Tour of 2020 was cancelled in its entirety due to Covid-19. Now, STATUS QUO are delighted to be able to announce their long-overdue return to the stage with the ‘Out Out Quoing’ tour.

Francis Rossi said, *“We cannot wait to play again. Every gig is special for Quo, but it’s been too long since we got to play anywhere. Going out is something that we all took for granted. Not any more. Going out, going out properly – ‘going out out’, as some would have it – became a bit of dream but now that dream can come true. The name of the tour is a bit of humour, but a celebration too. However, I’d urge fans not to overthink it and just prepare for all the hits and some serious live music energy!”*

STATUS QUO is a band known for their live performances across their incredible fifty-year career, it’s time to get back to doing what they do best. After such an unwanted layoff, the band is more ready than ever, making the ‘Out Out Quoing’ tour unmissable.

One of dance music’s most iconic figures comes to The Telegraph Building this October to help us celebrate our 25th Birthday.**

Norman Cook AKA Fatboy Slim is renowned as one of the most influential DJ/producers of all time. His litany of the ’90s and ’00s hits opened the door for electronic music as a mainstream phenomenon and we are delighted to have him return, for his first Belfast show since Belsonic 2016!

Fast forward to 2020 when staying home became the new normal, Norman Cook in the land of lockdown took to the online streaming phenomenon, inviting fans to join him live from his home. He released a series of 20 Lockdown mixes every Friday during the summer. In his usual relentless pursuit of fun, he also released his personal Back To Mine after-hours groove collection as part of a legendary and much-loved mix series. He then along with Idris Elba live-streamed a very special At Home With set from his kitchen along with a zoom audience in aid of the charity MIND.

The winter months saw Norman keeping warm at his much-loved Big Beach Café in Brighton. As a DJ, songwriter, bassist, art curator and father who’s been seen playing clubs, stadiums, festivals, fields, boats, and Brighton’s i360; it’s time for Fatboy Slim to don that Hawaiian shirt, kick off his shoes and reunite us all again unite under one roof raving.

They've tried moving my appointment and they told me that it needs lots of work and that it's probably not a property I want. Why would they be interested in not showing me the property? What could be in it for them to not show me the property?

They keep asking about my finances and I keep reassuring them I'm ready and prepared to buy...

Seems this is not in the interest of the sellers?  
Wouldn't the sellers be at a disadvantage and bothered to know that this agent is trying to put buyers off?

Curious to know why, so any thought are welcome.

Thanks"

I find it hard talking with people because guys either find me intimidating or the exact opposite and they come on waaay too strong expecting me to be easy because of how i look &amp; choose to dress and girls give me shit over it.
I used 2 be a lot bigger and am finally happy with myself but not outgoing an confident like everyone thinks i should be or am. 
Me and a my friends went over and said hello for two seconds at city hall and all I could manage to say to him was stuff about the dog :/ He was chill af and sound as and i wasnt ready to talk but mates knew I liked him and scundered me into going over. 
Saw him again the other day in town and somethin bad happened to him. Looked like he had a fit or somethin and was on the ground an he got up and sat lookin really upset and with his wee dog beside him . Nobody went near him and I wanted to go check but mates stopped and they didn't want to. Was talkin to them about goin over but by the time I got up on my own he was up walkin again with the dog and even gave us a smile when he went passed us but I felt too awkward to say anything when he went passed.
Really wanted to say hey and talk properly and get to know him a bit before all that and was plannin to if I saw him again but now I'm afraid he will think I was being a dick but I was really just shy and embarrassed cause I have a wee bit of a crush :/

I’m somewhat new to Belfast and looking for people who are similar age and wanting to make new friends. I am 24M and have been very isolated in lockdown and I’m moving to Northern Ireland. Originally from South Africa.

What are some good groups to join in Belfast? My interests are sports, mainly swimming, surfing, rugby and just about anything active.
Already a member of sports club but the guys are much older than me and have families etc."

I've just moved to Belfast with my family and am pretty confused by the bus ticket system and the translink website offers practically no advice on how the tickets work.  
   
I have the mLink app. Bought myself a day ticket, but I have 2 kids as well and seems like I can't buy a child ticket as well.  
  
Do both my kids need an mLink account?   
  
Also when I have this ticket bought, do I need to show it to the bus driver? Or am I good to just walk on the bus and only show it if asked?  
   
Apologies for the dumb questions, my anxiety won't let me get on the bus without knowing how to work it haha."

Oh Yeah opened its doors to the public on 5th May 2007. The centre normally programmes a live music celebration, but due to the pandemic, this will be the second year that the doors have been closed on its anniversary.**

The Virtual Tour of NI will instead celebrate some of our venues and artists via YouTube as we hope for a safe return to live in the coming months. The tour will set off on May 10th at The Oh Yeah Centre and will complete at The Rostrevor Inn on May 14th.

Like all venues across NI, Oh Yeah has been closed since March 2020. To date, there has been no indication of when live music venues might be able to reopen in the North. It has been a hugely challenging time and live music has disappeared from our lives completely. Nevertheless, there is a determination and resolution that it can’t always be like this. And so, as we start to slowly emerge from the most recent lockdown, Oh Yeah is renewing plans, refreshing memories and creating new opportunities.

We’d been sitting in a corner table and my back was to a door that looked archaic. No action out of this door for the first 2 hours. I sat my new plastic £4.80 pint on the ground in front of said  for 10/15 seconds about half a foot behind me SW to put my jacket on when it started pishing. The door opened and the pint with one sip out of it when to the limelight sewers. The guy that opened the door and accidentally kicked the pint over was the limelight employee that ushered us to the table to begin with. I did an over-dramatic sarcastic  “NOOOOOOO”. Your man half smirked and walked by. The door opened behind me again about 45 minutes later and he walked past us except this time he had to ask me to move because we’d repositioned the table to avoid some rain. He had to tap me on the shoulder and asked me to move (I was still blindsided). He said “least I didn’t knock your drink over this time”. I said/shouted “COUGH COUGH FREE PINT FREE PINT COUGH COUGH”. Few other tables overheard. As he was walking away he said “mate we were closed for a year I can’t be dishing out free pints”

I have moved to Northern Ireland last year after I've got a visa to work here. I've moved here a few weeks before the lockdown and since then I have been struggling a lot as I have no friends here. Because of covid/lockdown, I didn't meet anyone from my work as everything had to change to work for home basis. So yeah I work with people that I've never met in my entire life. hahaha

Also the way my work is it has little to no interaction with other work colleagues so it is really difficult to make any kind of bond or friendship.

I have tried to search for communities of people from my country that are living here but there aren't many and they all live in different places far away from me, so yeah it's difficult.

I think I do well by myself and I don't mind being alone often. But back in my country, I have always had friends to go out, have fun or have a conversation but now I am really struggling. Yesterday was the champions league final and I would have loved to go out with someone to watch the match and discuss it but unfortunately I don't know anyone. Yeah, I really miss having someone to just go out to the pub, have a few drinks and etc.

After restrictions have been lifted I started to go to the gym but like everywhere people are only focused to do their exercise and not very keen to have a wee chat. So yeah, no great lol.

Discussing my struggles with my friends they said to install some dating apps but I really don't feel comfortable with them and I am not looking to date or to be in a relationship at the moment.

I am not sure what to do. If anyone that isn't from here had the same experience could you share your best advice ?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am arriving in NI from Turkey via Poland in a couple weeks due to medical travel, and just wanted to know what documentation is required and what sort of boarder checks are done on arrival. I have an Irish passport, and both of my vaccines. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just have a couple questions:

\- Do I need print outs of my PCR from Turkey to present to an officer at the airport?

\- Does the hotel quarntine have to be pre-booked? My friend has an AirBnb place in the countryside, so I was wondering if a booking for that would be sufficent (already selling my left kidney for medical expenses lol).

I am a recent grad and have secured a job in Belfast after months of looking in this hellish job market. 

I am a bit anxious about moving so I wanted to get some advice. 

1. How expensive is it to live there? 

2. How diverse is the city? Would you say that Belfast is accepting towards people of colour like myself? 

3. I have been told not to speak in my English accent, what accent should I put on? 

4. Are there any parts of the city I should avoid to live/visit? 

5. Are there any trusted agencies that provide accommodation for young professionals in Belfast city centre?

I need to continue writing my MA dissertation over summer, libraries and QUB study spaces all close before 9pm and I'm trying to not work from my one bed flat all the time. What options are out there for a space that would be open a bit later, say 11pm ideally?

&amp;#x200B;

Does such a space exist? Maybe I could do a short contract with a co-working space somewhere nearby the uni; although some I have seen are around £120 for a month really I'm not going to spend that. My reasoning is that I work full time and it's nice to be able to finish, have dinner, and then go study a few evenings a week and I also want to maintain better habits of doing that in its own space and giving my partner their space too."

So, I have just finished my Masters and have secured a job in Belfast (situated in the docks). However, the job is WFH for the foreseeable future then moving to 3 days onsite/2 days home. I need to be in Belfast from August 1st. I would most likely move up with my partner in the last week of July. 
Questions:
Is it possible to secure a place to rent, solely doing so while remaining in the south? It will be difficult to go up and down for viewings. 
Are rental agents doing virtual viewings? This would be handy given my situation. 
Any tips that might help?

Many thanks for any help! 🙏🏼"
