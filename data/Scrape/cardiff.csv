Is it likely to extend beyond lockdown? Will people be moved to alternate accommodation? 

I live in the nearby flats and my girlfriend and I have just called the police for the second time this week. The first time was due to a huge fight breaking out outside with multiple men and women screaming about wanting to kill each other. 

We just got off the phone to the police again today after a man THREW A BRICK at another‚Äôs head. The victim walked off down Tyndall street with blood coming from his head and the attacker went after him on a bike. 

My girlfriend has been in tears as she is now fearing that we are no longer in a safe area. This area is usually very quiet with no trouble whatsoever since we moved here. 

I understand that people need accommodation but if the council can‚Äôt control who is allowed to go outside (I won‚Äôt even get onto the fact that hundreds of people could be spreading covid every day they are just roaming the streets), then I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing their job right. Some of these people (not all) are a danger to us and should be kept inside or even locked up."

It also seems horribly ironic in that it is endangering bame people more than any other.  (Covid seems to affect them more than others, for some reason).

Hi, I'm Andy, aka AJ Constable tattoo artist, (shameless plug, sorry if not allowed here) I work at Inked Up Custom Tattoos in Canton with Gareth who's been there 14 years. My rate is ¬£50/hour. ¬£250 day session for 6 hours. It‚Äôs looking like the studio will be shut for quite a while yet.

However, I‚Äôm still working and this is **a really good time** to plan and design your new tattoos so please don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch with any ideas. I‚Äôm taking deposits for new work, those who‚Äôve paid a deposit will be the first in que as soon as we open.   I have Gift Vouchers available from my website shop with **10% discount available** from:  [https://www.constattoo.com/gift-voucher](https://www.constattoo.com/gift-voucher?fbclid=IwAR0pLU3SdiaFbxRWmNU3xrnX71a9Vw7Kkx-QfMxet74vn2icImnjSgzJ3Ks)

I've forty years as a professional artist, my background is in illustration, technical and graphic design so that's how I approach my work. I would choose geometricaly based designs as a choice but I'm not restricted to any style, having a history in graphic design and the need to cater for many different design requirements. My favourite medium is black and grey, added red is always good too but I do full colour work as well.

I've gone down a bit of a rabbit hole this afternoon and was hoping somebody could shed some light on this.

[This](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article5714865.ece/ALTERNATES/s1227b/queensarcade3453450.jpg), as we all know, is the Queens Arcade entrance on the Hayes. However, I've just come across [this photo](https://www.alamy.com/town-centre-queens-arcade-shopping-city-of-cardiff-capital-of-wales-image8453554.html) of the same entrance (I'm guessing from the 90s, doesn't look any earlier), but the stairs go down rather than up.

If I'm looking at this correctly, the two images suggest the ground level was once higher than what it is today. Has there been a major restructuring of the ground level at some point since the earlier photo, or am I looking at it completely wrong? I can't remember it looking any different than it does now, and I can't wrap my head around how they could have made such a dramatic structural change to the ground considering the gardens and church opposite.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, I had a feeling it may have been the Queen Street entrance but it looks so similar to the Hayes entrance that I wasn't convinced. Cheers all!"

If you'd like to get involved and share your thoughts, **please complete my online survey (link below). It should only take 5 minutes and responses are completely anonymous.** Your time would be greatly appreciated!

My alternative was seeing if I could get a small plot of land in Cardiff to have a tiny house (although this has its own challenges).

I'm looking to book some people in for pretty much any type of photoshoot. I'm mainly interested in couples photoshoots, portraits, maybe a wedding or two, and family photos. I'm up for other types as well though so let me know if you're interested in anything else.

Because of corona if any shoots were done semi-soon I'd like for them to be outside for safety.

My question is what roles can I apply for that would contribute to my portfolio and progress into the product design industry? I want to take on something that I can balance with my studies next year and to look good or contribute to my portfolio.

Right now I would say I have a solid CV/portfolio, throughout college I worked with and for live clients such as the NHS, Cardiff and Vale College, 4Grounds, DS Smith and others. I am also working for a new business that focusses on MDF Model Terrain &amp; Scenery. I do my own designs for them earning royalties per sale as well as handling thier social media and building thier website.

My wife and I will be relocating to Cardiff in September. I'm from the US and my wife is from Sweden. I will be going for my masters at Cardiff U and my wife will be working full time. She's 33 and im 35. No kids, no pets. 

We're looking for a quiet neighborhood for people our age. We want to try to be close to campus/city center while avoiding the college/party/people passed out on the sidewalk stuff. We'd really prefer our own separate house, not an apartment. 2-3 bedrooms and with a backyard. Our budget would be about 1000 pounds max but would much rather prefer something cheaper. 

We keep searching and finding houses in Roath that we really like, just not sure how the neighborhood actually is. 

We both previously lived in the UK for three years so we generally know what to expect (houses are smaller, sometimes kinda quirky). Also, I totally know this COVID stuff is going on, quarantine would be expected when we arrive all that. Any other suggestions for COVID and whats going on specifically in Cardiff would be greatly appreciated.

**If you'd like to get involved and share your thoughts, please complete my anonymous online survey (link below).** It should only take a few minutes and your time would be greatly appreciated!

The intention of this research is to help the Cardiff City fan community, by providing them with a voice in this debate. Hopefully, this research will help to shape future policy surrounding the technology, as I intend to share the findings with relevant parties, including South Wales Police and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch.

Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post but we‚Äôre starting to run out of options.

Winnie went missing from Roath last Thursday (09/07/20) and is yet to be sighted.

She is a 2 year old black and white ‚Äòtuxedo‚Äô cat with a distinctive white patch on her back and a pink reflective collar. 

Please, if you‚Äôre local to the area, can you keep an eye out for Winnie and check any outdoor sheds/garages as she loves to sleep in secluded places. 

If found, please let me know via comment/DM or contact a local vet who will access our information via microchip. 

Any help or advice would be hugely appreciated!"

There was hand gel but he was not telling anyone to use it. No windows open. He's running by cash only. He's laughing and joking like this whole virus is a joke. Many of his customers are acting the same. It's not safe to go here.

Hi all! 

A much more jovial post this time around to let you all know that Winnie has been found safe and well. 

Despite managing to get herself locked in an empty house for the best part of 10 days (we‚Äôre guessing she had snuck in while the landlord was carrying out maintenance) the vet has assured us that she is in good health, albeit a little skinnier than she was before.

My partner and I would like to extend our thanks to everyone that got in touch to help out. Whether it was by offering a helping hand, by imparting advice on how/where search or by keeping us going with uplifting words of encouragement, you all played your part in helping Winnie find her way home safely.

I really do love this city.

Finally, we‚Äôd like to issue a plea to all landlords, agents and outgoing tenants. Please have a quick sweep of your properties before leaving them for any amount of time. Cats are mischievous creatures and, through no fault of your own, can end up in compromising situations without you even noticing. A quick check of empty rooms may well save the life of a beloved pet. 

Thanks again for all your support and if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, please don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch!"

They've been back to the property since to PLANT soot covered ""fire damaged"" ones AFTER the fire. We've lost most of our belongings and could have died but luckily we were awake and sat in the garden at 2am when it happened. The whole first floor was covered in flames with poisonous smoke filling the house by that point. Since we have tried to claim any compensation (we didn't have content insurance but then again they breached the tenancy terms which states they need electrical certificates, smoke detectors and carbon dioxide detectors.) We have no idea what to do. Since we've randomly met other tenants who claim that the same agency (Velvet Chase (who've become) Cardiff Properties Management) ripped them off too. They keep dissolving their agency and renaming it to get away with it. We can't afford to pay legal fees although we're pretty sure we would win. But again they would just file for bankruptcy. I've even emailed Joe Lycett to no avail.

I wanna know some things about this city:

\- cost of life with a possible minimum wage job

\- job scene in the hospitality industry ( I am an experienced waiter/barman) or other low skilled job that I can do with a basic foreign diploma.

\- Can I use the bicycle to get around the city

\- what to do in cardiff

\- the people are nice and welcoming? And how the foreigners are perceived?"

I'm Rob and am going to be coming over to Cardiff to get my master's degree this fall in Sports Psychology. I am from the US and am going to be looking for a place to live starting in September (preferably close to Cyncoed campus).

A little bit about myself. I'm 22 and don't take up much space. I live a fairly minimalist lifestyle and am looking for the cheapest rent that is close to Cyncoed campus. I want to mention that I am in recovery which may raise some red flags but I have been working the program well and know how to set up a support system to avoid a relapse. The only reason I am able to make this opportunity happen is due to sobriety so that is my number one priority. Obviously not everyone is in recovery and I am fine being around alcohol but would prefer to not live in a house that throws huge parties often. Also, I lead sound meditations and practice yoga so I will have some Tibetan singing bowls but I like to practice outdoors so I won't be playing inside all through the night. I have also lived on my own in the US for several years now so I am able to carry my share of housework and want to keep the peace as much as possible.

If anyone is interested in rooming together or knows anyone who has an open room available, please feel free to send me a message and we can figure something out. And if not, still feel free to reach out! I love to meet new people and would love to get connected before I get to Wales in September. 

One Love,

Rob"

I only refer to my age and ethnicity because, if I've had this level of abuse, I hate to imagine what women, old people, little kids, or non-locals would feel about walking through the park at night. Only the other night I overheard youths threatening to rape a woman as she cycled by on a bike.

We live in a terraced house in Cardiff (but outside the Cathays area). When it's rented it would be a 3 bedroom let (3 or 4 people max), 2 bedrooms upstairs (plus an office) and one downstairs. It's only 2 stories. All to avoid the HMO licensing requirements. I expect there are still some fire safety requirements but I can't find them.

I ended up hosting 2 girls in my home (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs appropriate to give their names). At the end of the school year it was our turn to travel to Cardiff and stay with the same students that hosted us. It was one of the most memorable and best experiences I have ever experienced because the family that hosted us where beyond nice. I learned so much from them and Cardiff was just beautiful. I have spent countless years trying to locate or communicate with this family through social media, internet, etc. One issue I ran across was their last name. Their last name was Smith and countless profiles would come up. I don‚Äôt even know the name of the school that all the students came from. The one thing I do remember is when I got to stay with my family I was offered my students bedroom and she had the most amazing view of a castle through her window. I expressed what a nice view it was to wake up to so they decided to take me to the castle for a tour, it was Castle Coch. It was about a 10 to 15 minute ride from their home. I don‚Äôt remember the town or the school the students came from I have tried to locate it also through google earth looking across  Castle Coch to the nearest town but nothing. Help!"

One place I saw that we quite like the idea of is the new Waterfront developments, apparently there is a Phase 2 available this time next year and we don't mind travelling into work from Barry. 

Which other areas could I look at? Has anyone bought one of the Barry Waterfront houses and would you recommend to buy here? (Would prefer to go with Taylor Wimpey or Barratt Homes and not Persimmon). 

There seems to be mixed reviews on facebook and the negative ones make it sound like a really bad place to live in.

Do you have any tips for someone like me where can I start? I am a bit confused about the curriculum and the books they use. If it helps I live in Cardiff so learning Welsh history is probably very important.

I know I am at disadvantage compared to other tutors but I am eager to learn. Any tips, opinions or critique is really appreciated thank you."

I'm in a band based in Cardiff that needs a new lead guitarist. We're influenced mostly by bands like The Cardigans, The Killers, The Manics etc but don't let that get in the way of a good jam if you haven't played that style before!

The band is a 4 piece with a female lead singer, and we're currently being mentored by a London based Manager who works for In De Goot Entertainment and wants to develop what he sees as our potential. We recently recorded with Jim Lowe, who produced some Stereophonics albums (including the single Dakota) because he heard one of our tracks and took a liking to it. We're serious about music and want to make it our full time job.

A confident player who can pick up music by ear and has spare time to commit fully is required.

Drop a DM/ reply here if you're interested.

Cheers

If you want to change your destiny for the better.  
 If you want to live up to 200 years old or even longer.  
 If you want to get richer, smarter and look more beautiful/handsome.  
 Then this is a special gift and the most value information you can find on the internet in 2020.  
 

Most people are living based on old traditional and influenced by families, societies rather than the Earth environment and personal choice. You must change your lifestyle if you want to have a better life, there is no any other choice.  
 

I will you give some advice with little change, easy to do but with significant result like a magic wand. This is beyond any education you can receive or have learn so far about life.  
 

**Lifestyle**  
 \- Remove all the hair in your all body as much as possible from legs,hands to any sensitive spot.  
 Because hair are just human body waste just like urine, shit. Unless you want to keep it for fashion,otherwise, there is no any reason to keep it.  
 \- Sleep when the moon is up (before 8 pm), and wake up when the sun start giving the light (around 6-7 am). The healing power is much stronger when the moon is up, and your body will be healed faster better during this time.  
 \- Take a bath 30 ‚Äì 60 minutes everyday. Swimming pool is better than Bathtub is better than Shower.  
 \- Massage your body with your own hands without any tools.  
 \- Turn off, avoid television, computer, phones as much as possible. Only using it for communication with others or seeking for some information you really looking for.  
 \- Do not take any drugs, medicine, vaccines.  
 

**Diet**  
 You must have an better diet with some time restriction, you cannot eat whatever whenever you want just like those animals. Instead, you should only have 1-2 meals a day, and each meal is within 30-60 minutes.  
 

**An example diet for 7 days you should try:**  
 \- 1 Day: Freestyle eat whatever at whenever you want.  
 \- 2 Day: 1 meal with only fresh raw fruits, vegetable, 1 meal with with cooked foods including both seafood and meat.  
 \- 2 Day 1 meal with raw fresh fruits,vegetables, 1 meal with cooked vegan products only.  
 \- 2 Day: both 2meals only with raw fresh fruits, vegetables.  
 

The amount of foods is up to your choice but eat as little as possible. Meat/seafood should never above 100 gram per meal.  
 Eat a lot of spicy/bitter/sour fruits, leafs as possible, they are the natural ‚Äúcure‚Äù for all kind of virus, bacteria, toxin in human body.  
 Eat a lot of green leafs as possible, try green smoothie.  
 You can pick the eating hour/day you like and match with your daily business.  
 

**Foods you should avoid:**  
 \- GMOs foods, foods contain artificial chemicals such as processed foods.  
 \- Raw or medium rare meat. All should be well done cooked.  
 \- Coffee, tea.  
 

Above is the magic formula you should give it a try right now if you want to change your destiny for the better.  
 Words are meaningless, science are crap, the only thing real is real life results.  
 

I can guarantee you can live up to 200 years old with just a simple formula like above.  
 

If you have any questions related to human health, lifestyle, you can ask me at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com** but only till **17/08/2020.**  
   
 The only thing can prove me as the real Savior is via real life result,all kind of words are meaningless. Give it a try to check guys gals !!!

Whoever is in the sales team for this web based app has pulled an absolute blinder and probably deserves a raise, as they've convinced an entire city to adopt a web based app with a terrble user experience.  
  
To name a few small issues with it:  
  
Despite registering for the service and providing my contact details, I have to manually re-enter my contact information every time I make an order. This is a huge miss as it's inconvenient, especially considering when I look in my order history it identifies that I'm the same person that has visited multiple venues. My assumption is that this works by some kind of device cookie, as I have never provided a password. Possible security concerns here. If you are ordering multiple dishes (or rounds of drinks) then this becomes tiresome.  
  
When eating/drinking somewhere that has multiple vendors (such as the Goodsheds and presumably the Castle Street cafe space) you can't order from multiple vendors at the same time, and if you change the vendor whose menu you're looking at, your basket gets emptied without any warning.  
  
Payment is a massive ballache as well. Thankfully they do have Google Pay integration for those of us that use it, but if you don't, you have to manually enter your complete card details for every transaction. No option to save card details, no Paypal or Amazonpay integration.  
  
The app doesn't look good, it looks and feels very clunky. Navigation isn't overly intuitive. And despite me constantly referring to it as an app, it is only a web-based app and there's no downloadable app version.  
  
I appreciate that I'm having a bit of a rant here, but I needed to vent and wondered what others' experiences of it are (those of you who have ventured out since lockdown started being lifted). Having worked in the software development world for ~15 years, I'm aware (hopeful?) that this is merely an MVP (*minimum viable product*)  that they've rushed out of development so that there's something that works, and there'll be future iterations that improve on it. But as it stands it is truly a god awful experience.   
  
Given they're a Cardiff based organisation and we have a fairly high number of IT workers on Reddit as a whole, I'm wondering if anyone in this sub works for Yoello? Are the issues I flagged above being looked into and developed on or is this the best we're going to get?"

First post ever, hopefully this is in the correct place. 

I am 32 M about to move to Cardiff in the next month or so for a new job in admiral (yay) 

Originally the move was supposed to happen in May but due to the lockdown obviously had to be postponed. 

I‚Äôve got a flat down Cardiff bay (which I understand is a desirable area!?) 

Everyone I‚Äôve ‚Äúmet‚Äù ( in quotations because I‚Äôve only met them virtually) in work has been super friendly and helpful and I get the impression that most cardiffians are generally just nice people and especially in admiral there is a good sense of community. 

So a few questions here really, has anyone else made the move to Cardiff to live? How long did it take to find your groove and settle in? I should mention I‚Äôm moving in by my lonesome as well. And generally what‚Äôs Cardiff like to live?

My boyfriend wants to climb Pen y Fan. The thing is I get quite stressed about the pressure of climbing a mountain with somebody else unless I've done it before and know the route and how difficult it is.

I'm planning on starting at Storey Arms and going from there. As a hill climbing newbie I've a few questions.

1. Is it safe to climb alone i.e. I'm not going to get lost on my own?
2. Is it busy enough in September that I wont be on my own totally on the climb up.
3. Is there a car park at Storey Arms?

Would want something with a multi point lock for insurance purposes and preferably something with a seal for insulation.

Does anyone know of any companies in the South Wales area who are still happy to supply and install one of these fire doors?

I can go into a lot more detail as required - but there is a current [traffic order proposal](https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/resident/Parking-roads-and-travel/Traffic-orders/Proposals/Traffic%20Scheme%20Proposals/C2525%20A4119%20Penhill%20Road%20-%20Cathedral%20Road.pdf) that will remove approximately 50% of all available parking next to the park (not including the car park itself) with all remaining car parking being permits and replacing it with c. 150m of bus lane. It literally doesn't even run the length of the road!

If anyone wishes to object to this they have until 19th Oct to email roadtrafficorderobjections@cardiff.gov.uk 

This is a major detrement to residents of the local area and anyone who visits Llandaff/Pontcanna fields."

By difficult, I think they are being a bit lazy and I have no idea how much they're willing to compromise. The only reason why I'm trying to help is that my mother has a tendency to say yes to anyone because she's too nice, and when asked by my aunt if these friends could live with them for 3 months - you can probably guess what she said.

We decided to go to Cardiff because i heard good things about it and my uncle lives there and he would help us until we get a job and salary. 

I want to ask some questions. Is it a good idea? I have a Tourism Degree. Any chance i get a job in some hotels or even anything else related to Tourism? What about other jobs? Is it hard to find a job? And what is the main offer for work there? 

Another question about language: is it important to have a perfect English when finding a job? Im not that bad talking English but there are times that i cant express myself. 

And how hard and expensive is to find a place to live? 

Looking for some comments. And recomendations."

j87n0k,Renting Dilemma: Options; Options Options! - Gileston or Penarth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiff/comments/j87n0k/renting_dilemma_options_options_options_gileston/,BX_V12,1,2020-10-10 07:51:08,5,/r/Cardiff/comments/j87n0k/renting_dilemma_options_options_options_gileston/,NA,"Sooooooo.... I'm in a bit of a pickle here (ish). I've been living in Cardiff for nigh two years now (and love it to bits).  

As it happens we can't stay in our current property. (Nothing bad/ominous!) 

While everyone's options have been weighed up, I signed for a place in Penarth which I'm set to move into next month. Contract signed and 500 quid deposit paid up the other day. ¬£460 PCM. 

BUT a room just came up in my landlady's other property in Gileston. Same rent as I pay now (¬£450) and no deposit obviously. Unfortunately she know the room was going to be free until AFTER I signed with this fella. 

I like the place in Penarth, I also went to her place in Gileston and I bloody well like it too! I obvs like her too, I've struck up a decent rapport over the past few years. 

Now (a) I'm torn as to which is the better bet? (b) If I was to pick the other place in Gileston, is there any way of breaking out of the contract before the tenancy has started (1st Nov move in date) and getting my refund in full or am I well and truly committed to Penarth. 

&amp;#x200B;

FWIW, I'm still not 100% on the pros/cons for each so if you guys do then feel free to add yours in for the list below! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros (Penarth):** 

\- Lively and vibrant; 

\- Not far from Cardiff; 

\- Probably more suitable for a 23 year old fresh out of uni; 

\- Probably better for someone of an ethnic minority (I've had some dodgy experiences in pubs further out into the Vale/Valleys) 

**Cons (Penarth):** 

\- Deposit. It won't cause me hardship and I won't miss it but hey... it's 500 quid at the end of the day. I guess. 

\- Don't know the fella renting. Seems like a sound bloke though!

\- Is there really any actual disadvantage? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros (Gileston):** 

\- It's a nice room (as is the other); 

\- I like the landlady. She's generally gone out of her way to make it very much a 'home' than simply 'a room' and if I had the time to do decorating I'd be allowed to do that if I wanted (within reason); 

\-  Landlady is willing to drop my rent below if I can get out of the contract (¬£20 ... every little helps when saving to buy your own gaffe!); 

\- Can have the entire garage for my motorbike and doing up project motors that I want to flip for profit; 

\- Can move in right now and my landlady understands that I'm on furlough (lite) atm. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons (Gileston):** 

\- Slightly increased fuel costs to work/the gym (Penarth is far enough from the gym!!... gainz... 16.1 miles at it's greatest at our Cardiff site or 60mi at it's greatest at our Swansea site); 

\- Longer commute depending on which site I'm working at - Cardiff or Swansea; 

\- I'm not sure what they're like towards ethnic minorities near there. But I have been to Monknash on a ride out to the Vale and I found them a bit unwelcoming to say the very least. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like to believe that I can go anywhere I want at this day and age, but I'm a young Black male (23) and alas that isn't always the case sadly so I'm mindful of that too!

&amp;#x200B;

Was wondering what r/Cardiff's thoughts were on this situation."

Anyway, the job I was hoping to get fell through and so I signed on.  Everything was fine at first but a couple months down the line, after lockdown started, a noticeable chunk was removed from my benefit.  So I went to my account and looked at the monthly statement from DWP, it said I'd received earnings (which I categorically had not).  I checked my HMRC PAYE account and it said I'd been paid by brew monster, and not just the small sum I had received a couple of occasions from them, it was a large amount.  The money you would expect a manager to receive.
  So I messaged the general manager, Tom, and he told me he'd also left the business to start a new career and had found them doing the same to him.  He said they'd claimed furlough scheme payments against his N.I. and that he'd exhausted every avenue trying to resolve the situation with them, including his solicitor sending letters.  He said he was taking them to court over the issue.  Then he sent me the various reporting methods he had used, and interestingly he told me that the director of the company is also the accountant, and is a chartered accountant so he shouldn't have any excuse for misfiling accounts (not just once, but several times).

 That was in april.  I messaged the new manager, Richard, and he said he'd look into it, but then kept kicking the can down the road.  Every time I messaged it took days and multiple reminders to get a response, and each response was the same.  Confusion, uncertainty, general mismanagement of the situation, and carefully worded messages in order to evade responsibility.  Eventually I got fed up and  I messaged the director of the company and asked for clarification on three occasions.  He ignored those messages.  Then I rang him and he picked up but when I told him what the call was about he hung up on me.  I tried again from another phone and this time he told me the police would have done something by now if he was doing something wrong, then he hung up on me again.  

 After lockdown had ended I walked past the bar a few times and spotted him on one occasion. When I confronted him he told me that if I came back he would kick my head in and warned me he ""used to do UFC"" (that's exactly what he said. Not MMA, UFC).

 Every single month since then I have had a statement from DWP followed by a two day window in which I have had to print bank statements and mail them to the DWP to have my benefit adjusted days later.  This has forced me to pay some bills with credit cards and with my overdraft, as well as causing a fair whack of stress.

I followed the former GM's advice (In his defence he was quite helpful despite having only known me briefly) and reported them to HMRC, the fraud line, companies house, and cardiff council, and so far nothing has worked.  I get template email responses from these bodies saying they'll contact me if they take things further.  

I'm at my wits end now and thought I might turn to the community for advice.  I'm angry, but not particularly interested in enacting revenge upon the business or the owner.  I mostly want to be rid of them and would like to know that no one else is put through anything similar by them.  Does anyone have any advice for me on how I can be absolutely rid of this awful company once and for all?"

In the One Planet Cardiff document it states

&gt; Restore the historic Cardiff City Centre water way as part of the redevelopment of the Canal Quarter masterplan

Here's the One Planet Cardiff document (it's 14mb btw)

[https://cardiff.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s41803/Cabinet%2015%20October%202020%20One%20Planet%20App.pdf?LLL=0](https://cardiff.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s41803/Cabinet%2015%20October%202020%20One%20Planet%20App.pdf?LLL=0)

So it be interesting to hear everyone's opinion regarding the canal.

Personally, I am maybe being cynical about it? I think it's a lot more about being a key feature of the Canal Quarter masterplan development than water management and biodiversity. They are just being used as an 'green excuse' for the development and some pretty looking CGIs.

  Guildford Crescent is being redeveloped, Cardiff lost some great independent businesses due to that and the public outcry managed to save the frontage of the buildings, for now.

As for the biodiversity, I can imagine canal being populated with species such as the greater floating traffic cone, the lesser spotted next bike and schools of beer cans. With summer bringing hoards of flying bugs, people who have ridden down the Taff Trail may of encountered this unexpected light snack.

For the construction my guesstimate for the cost would be in the millions, that's a load of ground works required.

 So this development will most probably happen but I would rather see a 'green way' rather than a canal. So my example would the High Line green way in New York (but not elevated btw). It would be cheaper and get loads of plants and trees into the area."

He is constantly drinking and smoking in his room. At night he is very loud and wakes up everyone. It is really getting very hard to live like this. We have to breathe second hand smoke and our sleep is disturbed constantly. He does not listen to anyone about this situation and just does what he want.

You   can pop to a supermarket to buy alcohol and cigarettes, but you're a   sinner if you want to buy a microwave. What drug addicted (because   alcohol and cigarettes are drugs,) luddite invented such a short-sighted   rule?

If  someone has children  and their cooker breaks down, and they lack a  microwave - they are now  supposed to wait 3 days for an online retailer  to supply them with one  instead of being able to pop out in an emergency  and pick a microwave  up from the supermarket. More so, the lower  working class may not even  be able to get online. So going by the rules,  their children supposed  to starve for at least 3 days whilst they can  continue drinking and  smoking.

If  someone has just had a  baby and didn't think about baby bottles -  woops, tough luck baby!  You're going to have to wait a few days, or  maybe weeks, before you can  let mummy have a rest.

In  short -  things such as microwaves, bedding, kitchen utensils, baby  bottles,  etc. - all of which have been covered up and refused to be sold  at  supermarkets, may not be ""every day essentials,"" but they certainly  are  ""essentials"" to some people.

Don't   get me wrong - I fully accept no one needs to instantly gratify   themselves with a new copy of FIFA, we can wait a few days, but so then   smokers can wait 2 weeks - it won't kill them - but not waiting 2 weeks   might.

Welsh  Government have  frankly lost the plot. I fully support a full on  lockdown - through to  next spring - but I do not and cannot support or  respect the notion of  restricting the sale of items that whilst may not  be ""every day  essentials"" certainly are ""essential to living in a  lockdown  environment"".

Instead  of dividing  it in to essentials / not essentials, they should have said  ""everyday  essentials,"" ""essentials"", and ""not essentials"" - with  lottery tickets,  drugs and liquour being in the last category,  microwaves, utensils,  baby supplies being in a mix of the first two.  Either the person who  invented the current rule is a luddite and lives  by candle light or has  never had to worry about feeding children on the  poverty line when the  cooker blows.

Then  we have the  ""don't visit anyone you do not live with!"" - well tell that  to my  neighbour. Today she has had 3 of her children visit from 3  different  places across south Wales.

""Call   the cops!"" I hear you cry. Sure, call 999 - they'll tell you it's not   life threatening and so don't call 999. Call 101 - they'll say it's not   an emergency so they ""probably can't do anything"" (but they can slap   your wrist for buying a microwave!) Then they will go over to your   neighbour, tell her they can't do anything, then come tell you they told   her not to do it - thereby a) she continues, and b) has a vendetta   against you.

Lockdown  good.  Unenforceable / unreportable breaches bad. Restricting access to   harmful substances good. Restricting access to essentials bad.

I   do not want to vote Tory, I am Welsh and proud, I cannot stomach a  Tory  - not even just a finger, but who the hell can I vote for that  will  ensure this current batch of working-class hating Labour-fakes get   kicked out."

The economy had to be propped up by the EU, let alone from London.

I would really hope that the same mistake isn't repeated whereby we vote for something and then try and figure out how to implement it. I'd only feel comfortable if Wales were given a full breakdown of what independence would mean and then we can decide if we want it."

At the same time,where's somewhere you don't like? (the more controversial the better!) I'll start...

**Favs:**

 **The Canton**, a proper pub in the sense that it's basically drinks only, people like to chat. Landlord is lovely, drinks are very cheap. If you roll with the frequent weirdness and the old school vibe then it's a real good time. Certainly an acquired taste but a rare one to find in this day and age.

**Flute &amp; Tankard** - Great bar staff, good Guinness and love the upstairs bit when there's music on. Needs new furniture. 

Special mention to **King's Yard** and **The Butcher's Arms (Llandaff)** 

**Least Favs:** 

**Crafty Devil's Cellar** - Don't like interior with all the bottles on ikea shelves, feels like a student's bedroom. Staff were incredibly rude to a friend with a speech issue. Overpriced/underwhelming selection given the competitiveness of the Cardiff craft scene.

**The Goat Major** - there is/was black mould all over the interior wall by the door? Bar staff seem really depressed and it just looks knackered inside. Shame as I was always brought up to believe it was sort of iconic given it's location. Mega underwhelming without being objectively terrible. 



Special mention to **Elevens**, fuck **Elevens.**"

Obviously, because I live with the person, I‚Äôm massively nervous about them going and bringing back COVID but at the same time, I obviously can‚Äôt stop them. 

So, basically, how is Cardiff right now? The cases are on the higher all over wales right now but are people following the guidelines? Any help would be massively appreciated and, hopefully, should help ease my anxiety a little bit. Thanks."

Place comes with all the usual mod cons you'd expect; oven, fridge, freezer, washing machine, bath &amp; shower, bed, 2 sofas, etc.

The questionnaire is hosted on Experimentum which is GDPR compliant and none of your personal data will be stored - if you wish to remove your submitted answers you can also do that by emailing either a student researcher or supervisor listed within the study and telling us your code you're asked to produce at the beginning.

For context, I'm ethnically Chinese.

First time: They kind of sounded like they were saying something in Cantonese to these two older Chinese women, so I asked if they (as in the grocer) could speak Cantonese (my parents speak it to each other sometimes even though I can't, so I know how it sounds like and vaguely know some words), and they replied, ""no"". I was just kind of in shock as I stood there realising that this person basically just admitted to mimicking a foreign language to their customers' face.

Second time was today, but I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it. I picked out lots of shallots and onions, and while weighing up, they turned to me holding the first shallot and said ""shallot?"" and I was really confused, so I said ""yeah?"" then they did the same thing with the onion, and I was like ""yes...? I am buying both shallots and onions..."" I don't know if it's a normal way of communication for them and ift they do this to all customers regardless of race/gender/age etc. (please let me know if they have) or if they actually assumed that a) I didn't know the difference between shallots and onions and b) I didn't know how to comprehend fully-formed English sentences because of the way I look.

I'd appreciate it if anyone could let me know if you have experienced or noticed something similar and what you make of it. Thanks."

I REALLY struggled to access the course, for example they told me I couldn't join the ensemble because of my instrument even though they let me on the course, or my instrumental teacher refusing to give lessons at the college even though she was a teacher at the college meaning I would have to drive all the way to her house during a long college day. I ended up getting illegally evicted from my flat and moving further out to somewhere not very safe for me, at this point the college persuaded me to take a year out of my studies to 'think of the others'. I did this but became very isolated. I was reaching out to people and they were straight up telling me that I'm not isolated, that I'm not depressed. I am away from my family for a reason because they have subjected me to a lot of abuse.  I ended up taking my life and died briefly, left with a brain injury and a lot of trauma. 

There have been a lot of issues since I am out of the hospital for example misunderstandings with people and me getting angry at people because of what happened or how they treated me or let me down. This has left me very isolated with nobody local I can call for help. I sent an e-mail to a few people at the college with a little bit about what's happened and how hard I worked to get into college (I come from a difficult family background with numerous care/institution stays so without the qualifications but worked in the music profession from a young age). The day after I sent that e-mail I had a member of staff at the college, a man in his 40s I don't know very well, trying to call me and KNOCKING AT MY DOOR. I was feeling really under the weather and turned my phone to do not disturb and stayed in bed. Next, the police are banging at my door. I can tell the officer is stressed and I can hear aggression in his voice, and COVID, so I don't want to let them in. They broke the door and entered my flat. The male officer, 6ft+ had me cornered in the room, was shouting at me, and I was very frightened and I screamed and put my arm out like 'stop, get away'. Long story short they threw me to the ground head first (with brain injury..), cuffed me very tight, and the officer in question held his hand down on my neck, I had to yell 'GET OFF MY NECK NOW BECAUSE I HAVE A BRAIN INJURY BECAUSE I DIED FROM LACK OF OXYGEN'. I got taken to the cells and spent the night screaming in terror.

I don't have friends at the college because nobody will talk to me. Initially upon leaving the hospital I got banned from some students houses and I didn't even do anything they just didn't want to face me. I used to go by their place and stop outside for a quick chat and then carry on my walk (I never even went inside) then one day I got a message saying I'm not to go there anymore.

Just a couple of days ago I had the police round, they refused to leave but they also had a go at me because there's stabbings going on elsewhere. I didn't even call them.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I feel like the world has shut all the doors on me and made me the bad person. I always worked and fought so hard just to be and now I don't' know what to do. I am tired of being silenced and punished constantly when other people are the ones behaving so badly."

I have read various opinions from it being a no go area to it is not as bad as people make out. I have been to Ely previously as a friend lived there and it was a lovely street.

My grandparents passed away at the start of the year and I have a number of old board games, a few VHS and also toys and books that has been taking up space in a spare room since the first lockdown and I now just need to get out of my house.

Does any know if any charity shops round Cardiff (hopefully accessible by car) take board games and maybe VHS? I think a lot don‚Äôt, I‚Äôd hate to throw things in the dump but for my mental health, I do need them out of my house.

I‚Äôve also got a IKEA desk with a big scratch on the top but otherwise fine - need to find a home for that too but nervous about free cycle these days for obvious reasons!


Any advice much appreciated!"

But on the majority of motorcycles you‚Äôll struggle to see ahead by more than your tyres even on full beam so you‚Äôre stuck going 25 - 30 mph while people tailgate/ beep furiously or commit some pretty daft overtakes.

When I was going home last night I noticed it was a little more lighter (still riding with caution) - I‚Äôm suspecting that what little lights are on during evening but in the early hours of the morning they are off. 

So yeah I was wondering like why on earth do the council not like to light up the street? Considering these aren‚Äôt just little cul de sacs, these are quite integral/ busy routes that cut through South Wales.  (even at 4am!)

Any suggestion is good ! 
We are pretty easy to convince when it comes to food : Traditional, Asian, African, European, South American, etc. 

We just don't want to cook and enjoy a nice meal on that day as we won't be able to eat out unfortunately. 
Thank you !"

Currently considering moving near/into Cardiff, from the south of England, with my partner in the near future, as it‚Äôs much cheaper to live and there‚Äôs better work opportunities for me in the Cardiff office.

I‚Äôm looking for some advice regarding the best areas to look at moving to. 

We‚Äôre looking to start a family shortly after moving, so would like to be in a safe area near parks and things for the kids and also would ideally need to be within walking distance of some shops/schools as my partner is unable to drive due to medical issues.

Ideally looking for a 5-6 bedroom house with parking and a garden. Looking at Rightmove this fits into our budget reasonably well.

I‚Äôd be working near Cardiff Queen Street Station, so an easy commute would be preferable.

Anyone have any suggestions on areas to look at/avoid?

Thanks"

I've had a little Google and it seems by far the best option is to use a bolt extractor to just remove the bolts. Given it's only ¬£20 - 30 for a kit I'm surprised the garage we rang doesn't have a set (or if they'd just prefer the ¬£70!)

How do I report the business for not informing guidelines? 

The only guidance online is to search for your local police force and breach of covid guidelines but in true form for the South Wales police the page has been taken down. 

I don‚Äôt want to report them to the police in any case, I‚Äôd rather inform the council to ask them to make a visit and issue guidance or an improvement notice but HSE says they don‚Äôt do that.

knu021,Bin collection issue (Pontprennau),https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiff/comments/knu021/bin_collection_issue_pontprennau/,Nation_Of_Moose,1,2021-01-01 03:50:42,14,/r/Cardiff/comments/knu021/bin_collection_issue_pontprennau/,NA,"I moved from Thornhill to Pontprennau at the end of the summer. In both instances I've been in a flat building but on a street with normal houses, in a housing estate (which is basically what both area's really!). The bin areas for both sets of flats are in a gated area to the side of the building but with easy road access, both with big industrial bins for general waste, an area for recycling bags to be left, and a small bin for food waste in bags.

Since moving here, half of the general waste collections have not been taken by bin crews. Recycling as been just as bad but as these are every week this has not cause as big an issue. Food waste was ok but has been missed the last 2 weeks.

Initially I went through the normal council phone route - you're not actually able to report a missed collection on the day because you have to allow until 10pm. Eventually (after a few calls) told that the bin crews could not access the bin area. At the time there was building work and a number of vans, but I spoke to the homeowner and in later weeks would see the builders move their vans for the bin crews. 

As mentioned since this we've had 3 other missed collections, which means the bin area gets completely full, and bags on the ground get torn apart by animals. At the flat in Thornhill we'd get weekly collections of everything (general, recycling, food) by a crew that only collected the industrial sized bins from our block of flats, it that crew didn't collect any waste from the houses with smaller household bins. They were able to get the big industrial bins through a carpark and up/down curbs - there's nothing as difficult as that here in Pontprennau to navigate, just a gate thats open. 

As you could guess, no collection happened on Christmas eve, I was on work calls when all the bin crews were collecting but saw them all look at our bin area and then drive off. Given its Christmas the rubbish is pilling up, and rather than wait until the council opened again 5 days later to report the collection I went straight to our local councillors, I'm still waiting for any tangible information, but our food waste hasn't been collected today and I'm not holding out hope for recycling again.

I realise this is quite a long post but given how much council tax is a month, its incredibly frustrating that a key council service just isn't being provided at all. 

I feel quite guilty that there's just a mountain of rubbish and it's disgusting for local wildlife but I don't know what else can be done. Since Christmas I've seen other areas putting bins out twice on my morning run, whilst we just have a big old pile of crap! Bin days are a day of window checking to see if maybe it will get taken, and both my partner and I work shifts so we are asleep in many instances, but I still feel I shouldn't have to go and confront bin crews to take waste.

Has anyone else had a similar situation, or experience with collections for flats? I can keep chasing the councillors but something isn't getting done, whether thats with the crews themselves or the way the building is categorised for collections."

Yesterday my poor mum (mid-60s) fell down the stairs.  Hurt her leg, banged her head, hurt her back. She called 999 at 12:05 (noon) and was told not to move as it was a suspected spine/neck injury and there could be a concussion, stay warm, and they'd send an ambulance as son as one was available. So my dad fetched a warm blanket and some more layers to try and make her a bit more comfortable at the bottom of the stairs.   

  

Now, I know the NHS is stretched at the moment, but I didn't realise it was this bad. Despite a few courtesy phonecalls to say she hadn't been forgotten about but without being able to provide ay ETA, the ambulance didn't arrive until 11:30pm.  For 11.5 hours my poor mother had to stay at the bottom of the stairs, in pain, and not moving. After taking her away by ambulance around midnight, she didn't get into  the assessment unit at the Heath until  3am.  

  

 We all know we have to be careful with social distancing etc at the moment, but if a woman with suspected spine/neck/head injuries has to lie waiting for an ambulance for almost 12 hours then the NHS in Cardiff  ***in general*** is far beyond stretched.   

  

Luckily they haven't identified any serious head, neck or back injury, and it's only (?!) a nastily broken leg. But just a cautionary note, look after yourselves because if you find yourself needing accident &amp; emergency support, you could be in for one hell of a wait."

So I'm Cardiff born and bred but pretty na√Øve when it comes to adulting if I'm honest, but I am getting better and since the pandemic I've really started to save much more effectively and shop wiser. 

I currently live in a house share and my rent is inclusive of all bills including council tax, so now that I'm interested in moving out and renting somewhere on my own I have no idea what the cost could look like because I've never had to worry about those things separately. 

I want to be realistic and make sure I'll be able to afford it but in my experience when I've had viewings in the past, estate agents are always a bit vague about monthly costs after rent. 

Ideally, I don't want to pay more than ¬£800 for rent and all bills including council tax, but I don't know if this is realistic. I've been thinking like you can get some decent places close to town for ¬£550-¬£600 and then I'm not sure if allowing another ¬£200 on top of that would realistically cover council tax, electricity, gas, water, broadband and TV license etc. Or if it would cost more? I really don't know where to look or how to start working this out. 

I'm also saving to eventually buy somewhere, so ¬£800 on rent and bills allows me to still put some money aside for saving and to have enough money to buy food and essentials. I don't want to bother leaving the houseshare if renting my own place is going to cost much more than ¬£800 because then I'll be worse off in terms of savings, although I do feel like I'd be mentally better off living alone than with housemates at the moment. Both of which are important things battling eachother in my mind right now haha.  

One of my friends who is renting a place with her boyfriend said they pay almost ¬£200 per month for their council tax and that they only pay it for 8 months of the year. I've looked at the council website and tbh I just can't really make head nor tail of it right now. If anyone could point me in the right direction of where to look or give me an idea whether ¬£800 for rent and all bills is doable It'd be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance"

My bike was stolen sometime between 9pm (when I last saw it) on 12/01 and 12 noon 13/01, from a bike rack outside Lumis Student Living, Capital Quarter, Tyndall Street. I feel like an idiot for relying on a cheap cable lock. If anyone could keep an eye out/suggest anywhere else to look in person or post this I'd be so grateful. I've reported it online, just waiting for a crime reference number to come through. Also I called Lumis Student Living and asked if they had CCTV, they said they'd share it with the police if the police approached them but I doubt that's going to happen somehow, would it be worth getting in touch with the police again once my crime reference number comes through and telling them about that conversation?

Terrible photo but it's the only one I had. It's a silver and green Carrera bike, hybrid, not sure of size but not especially big (I'm 5'4"" and it felt perfect). 21-speed, grip shift gear levers, black rubber grips on handlebars, except for the sticking-up metal handles that come out at right angles. I'm not sure what they're called, but they are in the photo. It had a water bottle holder. When it was stolen there were two clips for attaching bike lights but they could be removed super easily. The bike was about 10 years old. A slight bulge in the back tyre but otherwise it worked very well.

Thanks so much if anyone can help.

I was living off a bit of savings after losing my job but have now had to apply for UC. I‚Äôm still in the process of confirming my identity, and we‚Äôve been left with no food at all until I can sort it.

Does anyone remember a couple years back, top of Newport Road by Queen St, near to Greggs and in the sort of tunnel bit, under the train tracks, there used to be a man who would write on to white sheets. There would be loads of them and I never had time to stop to see what he was writing about, but it seemed to be about himself and his experiences with the police or something like that, maybe something about being falsely imprisoned?

He would be there maybe once a week and I would see him every single week. I always used to think that it seemed as if it took a lot of time to write all that information out. He was always painting/writing while he was there, I don't think he ever came with the information already written out. 

I haven't seen him since lockdown started last year and I was wondering if he was ok. I also wanted to know if anyone knew what he was writing about or if they have any pictures, as he obviously wanted to grab people's attention and inform people of his experiences."

I am going to be honest, as an international student I kinda fucked up with my finances and spent much more than I should have during my initial months. 

I still have savings left but I really do not want to touch them in the nearby future. I have worked as a marketing consultant, marketing manager, Digital marketer before. Most of my work waa for US based clients but unfortunately due to the visa restrictions, I cannot work for any employer abroad.

I really would like to find a part time work which could help me with my rent and food expenses. I tried finding work at Tesco's, Marks &amp; Spencers and other retail stores but looks like none of them are currently hiring. 

I am open to work in retail, administrative roles, healthcare or hospitality industry. Pretty much anything works for now.

All the suggestions are welcome :)"

I've just moved back  to Wales from England.  And need to find a dentist in Cardiff for routine work etc. But not rushing for any immediate appointment right now. 
My experience from moving about in England is that NHS dentists are hard to find, often... not the best. But always a lot cheaper then private practices, so is in there any NHS dentists that aren't glorified butcher shops in Cardiff preferably near Roath?
 I realise this might be a dream list and might have to sit on a waiting list for 6 months. But if I'm waiting it may as well be for a half decent option.
Thanks!"

Looking to buy a house in Cardiff and this is one of the areas I am considering. Specifically around St Agnes/St Agatha/St Anthony. I have walked around there a while ago and it seemed nice enough. I am concerned being so close to the hospital means there may be a lot of noise/dirt and given it is a hospital this will be 24/7 - am I being overly concerned?

Any suggestions on other parts of Heath or the City in general would be good. The budget is up to 450K but not necessarily looking to spend it all if possible (the heath houses mentioned above range from 330-375K).  Other places I have looked at or thought about are Rhiwbina, Whitchurch and Llanishen. Do you any you have any pros/cons of these areas?

Cultural sites. What history should I be aware. Of. Any monuments castles. And major events that happened that in should be aware of?

We let him (or her) in out of the snow earlier today and he very boldly walked into our house and started to march around, seemingly looking for something. He continued to meow loudly the entire time.

We decided to feed him some tuna in case he was lost and wasn't being fed, which he readily ate up.

My gf, who has had cats most of her life, says he doesn't seem like a stray as he has a long black coat that seemed to be well kept. He looked like he's been in a pretty bad fight with fur torn from just under his left cheek and more just above his ear. Couldn't get a good view but also looks like a wound there too. His head was also somewhat bumpy to stroke - could be  smaller bites under his fur?

I got some pictures which I will try to upload in the next while. He's a pretty large, long-haired, all black cat with yellow eyes. Has anyone had a cat go missing in the Roath area in the past few days?"

As per title!

Looking at moving to the countryside north of Bridgend (Llangeinor, Bettws) as a multigenerational family but wanted to know if there's any hope of a social life for the three of us who are 20 something.

Not looking for nightlife or whatever, more along the lines of crafts, gaming, walking groups, pub quizzes that kinda thing. Because of the current times I'm finding it impossible to find anything because of course noone has been posting events for over a year!

So, what is there to do if you aren't a child and aren't a pensioner? We're all likely to spend most of our time riding horses or walking dogs but a bit of a change and a social life is important. I know It's not far from Cardiff but I don't necessarily want to be going that far all the time.

I've visited Bridgend and it looked nothing special but big enough that I felt there had to be something going on at least occasionally!"

I am a 26 years old international student who moved to Cardiff a few months back. Ever since I came to the UK, I have seen a lot of skateboarders just casually strolling on the streets and it has kinda spiked my interest in this fun looking activity. 

I stayed in Bristol for a month and the number of skateboarders there were definitely higher than what I see here in Cardiff. Maybe I just live in the wrong area of Cardiff or maybe Skateboarding is not that big here afterall.

So, I just wanna know from you guys if there are skateboarding parks/areas around here where I could meet/befriend skateboarders and even learn from them?

I live nearby Cathays so the closer the better :) .

Thank You."

Hi all,

Just looking for suggestions of nice towns ect with easy commute 

Partner and I have been renting in Cardiff for around 5 years
I work in West Cardiff, and he works in Newport.

We've discussed looking outside of Cardiff to rent for a while, but as we haven't lived anywhere else in SW, we're looking for suggestions üòä

Partner will be taking driving lessons once restrictions lift

We have of course discussed Newport, but one reason we want to move is to escape the city a bit (I'm from North Wales originally and want to see some green!)

TIA"

Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

The proposed plans include the removal of trees, recreational and jogging routes, and nature habitats, to connect Llandaff and Bute Park, despite it already being a relatively easy cyclable route.

Both societies have launched protests towards the scheme following the Council's other recent initiatives that have destoyed greenery in the area, including historic trees (such as Romily Road), but both say they have been largely ignored. 

Citing how pandemic  has highlighted the need and importance of green space, protestor have said the plans will  destroy sections of our green space, to create ""higher speed"" routes that prioritise hardcore cyclists over other members of the public - and that the type of  infrastructure isn't needed in the area. 

Cardiff Civic Society has also called into question the conflict of interest between one Councillor supporting the scheme and his role as a founder of a privately funded cycling lobbying group. But again say they've been largely brushed aside and ignored. 

Cardiff Council has said the path is needed to encourage Active Travel across the city and reduce air pollution in the area. 

Whether you're in favour of the scheme or not, you can view the plans and have your say on the consultation here: 

https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/resident/Parking-roads-and-travel/travel/cycle-super-highways/Documents/CW4.2_Options_ConsultationPack_ENG_19032021.pdf


*my personal take, feel free to ignore*

While I'm sure this will be a totally civil discussion, the debate on prioritising active travel typically has been focused around ""cars vs bikes"", but this isn't that. 

As a cyclist, I agree with the park societies that this feels like the destruction of our environment, habitats and public green space for  to make a route that is already a pedestrian one easier and faster to cycle through, and in my opinion to turn it into a flat, high speed recreational cycle track for hobbyists and cycle groups (to casual cyclists, the route is relatively alright currently) to treat as a race course, at the expense of joggers, walkers, the environment, animals and other track users 

*end of personal take*

It's a really controversial concept that's definitely going to split people, but regardless of your views on it let's all play nice"

 It's a really good hobby for getting any aggression out because you get to stab wool over and over! I wouldn't recommend it as a hobby for small children though.

It hurts because it more than cancels out the promotions I've had at work over the last two years which were a lot of hard work, what's the point.  


I know there is bigger problems out there and that those already on the property ladder will probably not understand.

Just had that appointment and I was told 'look harder for NHS dentists, or go private, or check out a pharmacy to see if they have any filling kits so you can do it at home'.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently bought a tent and I would like to go for some camping, nothing major, something like 1-2 nights in a forest. I've called up a lot of campsites around south wales but it seems like everything is open only for caravans due to covid (they're not allowed to have shared toilets).  


I am tempted to just go do some wild camping but I am not sure if there are any good places around cardiff where you can do that. I would rather not invade some random farmer's field if possible... I was thinking about places like caerphilly mountain (somewhere on the side out of sight) etc but I am not sure if these places are frequented by dodgy teenagers, chavs etc.   


Did anybody have any experience with tenting near cardiff? Any cool spots where I could safely set up a camp?"

I'll be moving to Cardiff from London soon and just trying to figure out how and where to look for rental property.

I set up alerts for both but so far no luck! I will be looking for a furnished studio/one bedroom somewhere central.  Additional caveat is that I will be commuting (by car) to Cwm Taf hospitals so I need relatively easy access to the motorway (but still central to have access to shops and restaurants etc).

She has applied to 20+ places the last few months and hasn‚Äôt even managed a single interview. If you‚Äôve ever applied for a teaching job you‚Äôll probably know how demoralising this is - you spend a weekend writing a five page report and then either get NOTHING back saying you haven‚Äôt got an interview, but at the very best a generic email saying bad luck. 

I‚Äôm basically at a loss for where we can go from here - she just got turned down from a place which she did her PGCE at - one of the teachers rang her and asked her to apply because she thought she stood a great chance, and the head often texts her to ask if she‚Äôs free for supply work. There were four other applicants and she still couldn‚Äôt even get an interview. It‚Äôs a hard one to pick yourself up from. 

So yeh basically I‚Äôm asking does anyone know of any places that are hiring someone of her age (25), or have any tips for her at all, being a young applicant in Wales?

I (33/F) hope to come to Cardiff this September for my postgrad! I'd like to rent a studio, but Cardiff University offers few of those and they are less than ideal. I've been looking at a bunch of private student halls that seem to offer better amenities, in a better location, for around the same price range. I know I could probably get a better deal dealing with individual landlords but it seems like way more of a gamble, and I would like to be around other students, and just generally pay for the convenience of not having to deal with separate utilities bills.

I have to book a place for the whole year, prior to my arrival! Cardiff Students' Union has been really helpful in providing me with general information on remote viewings, signing contracts, etc, but obviously any any reviews/advise from prior/current residents of any of these private halls, or Cardiff residents in general, would be extremely helpful! 

**My priorities:**  
\-¬£165-185 per week  
\-No more than 25 min walking distance from Central Square (I'll be studying primarily at JOMEC, next to BBC Wales)  
\-Nearby grocery store  
\-Mixed student population (in both age and nationality!)  
\-No loud construction nearby (ideally: friendly but not massive, noisy hall)  
\-Room with good natural light and ventilation (ideally: not super cramped)  
\-A kitchenette that can be used for more than just making pot noodles from the kettle 

**Places I'm currently looking at (but open to more suggestions):**  
\-The Neighbourhood  
\-Eclipse  
\-The West Wing  
\-Livin  
\-Arofan House  
\-Lumis

One BIG concern is that I need to negotiate with whoever I sign with to include a break clause in the contract so I can get a refund IF (worst-case scenario) my visa is rejected. So if anyone can speak to their experience with negotiating with private halls that would also be super helpful!"

If you had a flight that was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19, we would love to talk to you about this. We offer a ¬£20 Amazon Voucher upon completion of our focus group. If you want to express your interest, please fill out the following form: [https://cardiff.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/study-on-consumer-rights-and-flight-cancellations-during-c](https://cardiff.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/study-on-consumer-rights-and-flight-cancellations-during-c)

o46tnq,Moving to Cardiff in October. Need nerdy friends!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardiff/comments/o46tnq/moving_to_cardiff_in_october_need_nerdy_friends/,JonahJJamesonV2,1,2021-06-20 23:54:53,0,/r/Cardiff/comments/o46tnq/moving_to_cardiff_in_october_need_nerdy_friends/,NA,"Howdy folks! 

I hope you‚Äôre all well and keeping safe in the current times. I‚Äôm intending to move to Cardiff in October to hopefully kickstart my career in sound design for television and I‚Äôve literally just realised that I‚Äôm not going to know anyone, which is sad. I graduated from university about a year ago and am getting bored of just waiting around and not doing anything that I actually want to do. 

I‚Äôd love to make some friends before I move just to make life a little easier, if that makes sense. I‚Äôm happy to talk to anyone around my age (mid 20s). It‚Äôll help if we have things in common, like music, into nerdy films and tv, gaming etc. But I‚Äôm pretty easy going as well. All I ask is that I meet some nice people :) I‚Äôm also open to recommendations of things to do when I get there! 

Hope to speak to some people soon! 

All the best,
Alexander :)"
