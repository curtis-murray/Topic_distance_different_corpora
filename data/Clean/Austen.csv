Pride & Prejudice Chapter 2 Jane Austen,equally sprung from his appearance he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice and expression had he been even old ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of mrs dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child but the influence of youth beauty and elegance gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings she thanked him again and again and with a sweetness of address which always attended her invited him to be seated but this he,Jane Austen,65

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 6 Jane Austen,cried marianne indignantly but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius sir john was rather puzzled upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as to all that but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw was she out with him today but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr willoughby's pointer than he could describe to her the shades of his mind but who is he said elinor where does he come from has he a house at allenham on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence and he told them that mr willoughby had no property of his own in the country that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court to whom he was related and whose possessions he was to inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides and if i were you i would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself brandon will be jealous if she does not take care i do not believe said mrs dashwood with a good humoured smile that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching,Jane Austen,69
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 7 Jane Austen,him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived repeated sir john i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced from eight o'clock till four without once sitting down did he indeed cried marianne with sparkling eyes and with elegance with spirit yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert that is what i like that is what a young man ought to be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor brandon that is an expression sir john said marianne warmly which i particularly dislike i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one's cap at a man or making a conquest are the most odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,Jane Austen,70
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 8 Jane Austen,time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity sir john did not much understand this reproof but he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles chapter 10 marianne's preserver as margaret with more elegance than precision styled willoughby called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries he was received by mrs dashwood with more than politeness with a kindness which sir john's account of him and her own gratitude prompted and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance mutual affection and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced miss dashwood had a delicate complexion regular features and a remarkably pretty figure marianne was still handsomer her form though not so correct as her sister's in having the advantage of height was more striking and her face was so lovely that when in the common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl truth was less violently outraged than usually happens her skin was very brown but from its transparency her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features,Jane Austen,71
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 9 Jane Austen,were all good her smile was sweet and attractive and in her eyes which were very dark there was a life a spirit an eagerness which could hardily be seen without delight from willoughby their expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created but when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect good breeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing he was passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk she could not be silent when such points were introduced and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions she proceeded to,Jane Austen,72
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 10 Jane Austen,question him on the subject of books her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works however disregarded before their taste was strikingly alike the same books the same passages were idolized by each or if any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed he acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm and long before his visit concluded they conversed with the familiarity of a long established acquaintance well marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask elinor cried marianne is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i,Jane Austen,73
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 11 Jane Austen,have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared my love said her mother you must not be offended with elinor she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend marianne was softened in a moment willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer he came to them every day to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by marianne's perfect recovery she was confined for some days to the house but never had any confinement been less irksome willoughby was a young man of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners he,Jane Austen,74
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 12 Jane Austen,was exactly formed to engage marianne's heart for with all this he joined not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together his musical talents were considerable and he read,Jane Austen,75
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 13 Jane Austen,with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted in mrs dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in marianne's and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her and his behaviour declared his wishes,Jane Austen,76
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 14 Jane Austen,to be in that respect as earnest as his abilities were strong her mother too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons in law as edward and willoughby colonel brandon's partiality for marianne which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to elinor when it ceased to be noticed by them their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings,Jane Austen,77
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 15 Jane Austen,began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which mrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon she saw it with concern for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty and as she could not even wish him successful she heartily wished him indifferent she liked him in spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest his manners though serious were mild and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper sir john had dropped hints of past,Jane Austen,78
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 16 Jane Austen,injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby one day when they were talking of him together whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne do not boast of it however said elinor for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him that he is patronised by you replied willoughby is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust in defence of your protege you can even be saucy my protege as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good breeding and good nature that is to say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome he would have told me so i,Jane Austen,79
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 17 Jane Austen,doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed perhaps said willoughby his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body's good word and nobody's notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year add to which cried marianne that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no,Jane Austen,80
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 18 Jane Austen,expression you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied elinor and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart miss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever chapter 11 little had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment yet such was the case when marianne was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put into execution the private balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection elinor could not be surprised at their attachment she only wished that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to marianne but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common place and mistaken notions willoughby thought the same and their behaviour at all times was an illustration of their opinions when he was present she had no eyes for any one else every thing he did was right every thing he said was clever if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners,Jane Austen,81
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 19 Jane Austen,for half the time and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame and seemed hardly to provoke them mrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind this was the season of happiness to marianne her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought with her from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home elinor's happiness was not so great her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret,Jane Austen,82
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 20 Jane Austen,than ever neither lady middleton nor mrs jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed although the latter was an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times and had elinor's memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr jennings's last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits,Jane Austen,83
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 21 Jane Austen,were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion willoughby was out of the question her admiration and regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly marianne's and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing colonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister elinor's compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been,Jane Austen,84
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 22 Jane Austen,known to him this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while the others were dancing his eyes were fixed on marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist i believe she does but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself this will probably be the case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to,Jane Austen,85
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 23 Jane Austen,see them give way to the reception of more general opinions i cannot agree with you there said elinor there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne's which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment or is it equally criminal in every body are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable this said he cannot hold but a change a total,Jane Austen,86
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 24 Jane Austen,change of sentiments no no do not desire it for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an inforced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered elinor's head the lady would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips as it was it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard elinor attempted no more but marianne in her place would not have done so little the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love chapter 12 as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated,Jane Austen,87
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 25 Jane Austen,a piece of news to her sister which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne's imprudence and want of thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both marianne told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and told her sister of it in raptures he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added and when it arrives we will ride every day you shall share its use with me,Jane Austen,88
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 26 Jane Austen,imagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop on some of these downs most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle mama she was sure would never object to it and any horse would do for him he might always get one at the park as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little or at least so lately known to her this was too much you are mistaken elinor said she warmly in supposing i know very little of willoughby i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mama it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from willoughby of john i know,Jane Austen,89
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 27 Jane Austen,very little though we have lived together for years but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more she knew her sister's temper opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion but by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she consented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell willoughby when she saw him next that it must be declined she was faithful to her word and when willoughby called at the cottage the same day elinor heard her express her disappointment to,Jane Austen,90
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 28 Jane Austen,him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible his concern however was very apparent and after expressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voice but marianne the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now i shall keep it only till you can claim it when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shall receive you this was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between them from that moment,Jane Austen,91
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 29 Jane Austen,she doubted not of their being engaged to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover it by accident margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest sister when they were next by themselves oh elinor she cried i have such a secret to tell you about marianne i am sure she will be married to mr willoughby very soon you have said so replied elinor almost every day since they first met on high church down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his but indeed elinor it is marianne's i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night after tea when you and mama went out of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be,Jane Austen,92
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 30 Jane Austen,and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket book for such particulars stated on such authority elinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister when mrs jennings attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was,Jane Austen,93

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 37 Jane Austen,sir john when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it,Jane Austen,100
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 38 Jane Austen,at all oh he must and shall come back cried sir john if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him ay so do sir john cried mrs jennings and then perhaps you may find out what his business is i do not want to pry into other men's concerns i suppose it is something he is ashamed of colonel brandon's horses were announced you do not go to town on horseback do you added sir john no only to honiton i shall then go post well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind i,Jane Austen,101
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 39 Jane Austen,assure you it is not in my power he then took leave of the whole party is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss dashwood i am afraid none at all then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing come colonel said mrs jennings before you go do let us know what you are going about he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed i can guess what his business is however said mrs jennings exultingly can you ma'am said almost every body yes it is about miss williams i am sure and who is miss williams asked marianne what do not you know who miss,Jane Austen,102
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 40 Jane Austen,williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel's my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor she is his natural daughter indeed oh yes and as like him as she can stare i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country the carriages were then ordered willoughby's was first and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it he drove through the park very fast and they were soon out of sight and nothing more of them was seen till their return which,Jane Austen,103
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 41 Jane Austen,did not happen till after the return of all the rest they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that every body should be extremely merry all day long some more of the careys came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods mrs jennings sat on elinor's right hand and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and willoughby and said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray did not you know said willoughby that we had been out in my curricle yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago marianne turned away in great confusion mrs jennings laughed heartily and elinor found,Jane Austen,104
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 42 Jane Austen,that in her resolution to know where they had been she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr willoughby's groom and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose or marianne consent to enter the house while mrs smith was in it with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance as soon as they left the dining room elinor enquired of her about it and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs jennings was perfectly true marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than,Jane Austen,105
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 43 Jane Austen,mr willoughby mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith's grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby's and if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be justified in what you have done she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her sister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather ill judged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful it is a corner room and has windows on two sides on one side you look across the bowling green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture but if it were newly fitted up a couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest summer rooms in england could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight chapter 14 the sudden termination of colonel brandon's visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings for two or three days she was a great wonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance she wondered with little intermission what could be the,Jane Austen,106
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 44 Jane Austen,reason of it was sure there must be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she i could see it in his face poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so i would give anything to know the truth of it perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her may be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion she is always rather sickly i would lay any wager it is about miss williams it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now for he is a very prudent man and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time i wonder what it can be may be his sister is worse,Jane Austen,107
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 45 Jane Austen,at avignon and has sent for him over his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it well i wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain so wondered so talked mrs jennings her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour,Jane Austen,108
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 46 Jane Austen,to each other declared to have taken place elinor could not imagine she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of his poverty but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at all she could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all than willoughby's behaviour to marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his favourite pointer at her feet one evening in particular about a week after colonel brandon left the country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around,Jane Austen,109
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 47 Jane Austen,him and on mrs dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him what he exclaimed improve this dear cottage no that i will never consent to not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch to its size if my feelings are regarded do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of the kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it i am heartily glad of it he cried may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements in the world depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it i am said he to me it is faultless nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose said elinor yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thing belonging to it in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share mrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well she understood him how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring,Jane Austen,110
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 48 Jane Austen,its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne speaking to her in a lowered voice then continuing his former tone he said and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford mrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted you are a good woman he warmly replied your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that,Jane Austen,111
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 49 Jane Austen,i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me the promise was readily given and willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness shall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs dashwood when he was leaving them i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton he engaged to be with them by four o'clock chapter 15 mrs dashwood's visit to lady middleton took place the next day and two of her daughters went with her but marianne excused herself from being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home on their return from the park they found willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage and mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just so far it was all as she had foreseen but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into,Jane Austen,112
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 50 Jane Austen,the room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back towards them he turned round on their coming in and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over powered marianne is anything the matter with her cried mrs dashwood as she entered is she ill i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment disappointment yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on business to london i have just received my dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you to london and are you going this morning almost this moment this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must be obliged and her business will not detain you from us long i hope he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth and is,Jane Austen,113
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 51 Jane Austen,mrs smith your only friend is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here his colour increased and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied you are too good mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for a few moments every one was silent mrs dashwood first spoke i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself he stopt mrs dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded this was broken by willoughby who said with a faint smile it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room they,Jane Austen,114
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 52 Jane Austen,saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight mrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister the distress in which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what marianne's love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sister's affliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must,Jane Austen,115
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 53 Jane Austen,have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you can you indeed yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say nothing for you have anticipated my answer then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for marianne and,Jane Austen,116
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 54 Jane Austen,guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would,Jane Austen,117
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 55 Jane Austen,have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him do not blame him however for departing from his character where the deviation is necessary but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness i want no proof of their affection said elinor but of their engagement i do i am perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought,Jane Austen,118
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 56 Jane Austen,occur to you how is it to be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sister's love should leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister's wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful i hope not i believe not cried elinor i love willoughby sincerely love him,Jane Austen,119
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 57 Jane Austen,and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not,Jane Austen,120
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 58 Jane Austen,raise objections against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret and elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother to acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word her eyes were red and swollen and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after some time on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst into tears and left the room this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening she was without,Jane Austen,121
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 59 Jane Austen,any power because she was without any desire of command over herself the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was impossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him chapter 16 marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from willoughby she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it but the feelings which made such composure a disgrace left her in no danger of incurring it she was awake the whole night and she wept the greatest part of it she got up with a headache was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either her sensibility was potent enough when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling she played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her till,Jane Austen,122
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 60 Jane Austen,her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained and this nourishment of grief was every day applied she spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears in books too as well as in music she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving she read nothing but what they had been used to read together such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy but these employments to which she daily recurred her solitary walks and silent meditations still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever no letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected by marianne her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy but mrs dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post,Jane Austen,123
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 61 Jane Austen,and carries them to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john's hands elinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence but there was one method so direct so simple and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery that she could not help suggesting it to her mother why do you not ask marianne at once said she whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a,Jane Austen,124
