Castle On The Hill Ed Sheeran,when i was six years old i broke my leg i was running from my brother and his friends and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down i was younger then take me back to when i found my heart and broke it here made friends and lost them through the years and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long i know i've grown but i can't wait to go home i'm on my way driving at 90 down those country lanes singing to tiny dancer and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends had my first kiss on a friday night i don't reckon that i did it right but i was younger then take me back to when we found weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how we've grown but i can't wait to go home i'm on my way driving at 90 down those country lanes singing to tiny dancer and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill over the castle on the hill over the castle on the hill one friend left to sell clothes one works down by the coast one had two kids but lives alone one's brother overdosed one's already on his second wife one's just barely getting by but these people raised me and i can't wait to go home and i'm on my way i still remember these old country lanes when we did not know the answers and i miss the way you make me feel it's real we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill over the castle on the hill over the castle on the hill,Ed Sheeran,126

All Of The Stars Ed Sheeran,it's just another night and i'm staring at the moon i saw a shooting star and thought of you i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew if you were here i'd sing to you you're on the other side as this skyline splits in two miles away from seeing you but i can see the stars from america i wonder do you see them too so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home i can hear your heart on the radio beat they're playing chasing cars and i thought of us back to the time you were laying next to me i looked across and fell in love so i took your hand back through london's streets and knew everything led back to you so can you see the stars over amsterdam hear the song our heart is beating to so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home and all and all and all i can see the stars from america,Ed Sheeran,129

Eraser Ed Sheeran,i was born inside a small town i've lost that state of mind learned to sing inside the lord's house but stopped at the age of nine i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride the paving stones i played upon they kept me on the grind so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride and when the world's against me is when i really come alive and everyday that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride you know that i've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up instead i look in the mirror questioning what i've become i guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me without a nine to five job or an uni degree to be caught up in the trappings of the industry they showed me the locked doors i find another use of key and you'll see i'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me but with that said give me one more higher another one to take the sting away i am happy on my own so here i'll stay save your lovin arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs i chased the pictured perfect life i think they painted it wrong i think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps because you're living your dream man this shit should be fun please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run i beg you don't be disappointed with the man i've become our conversations with my father on the a14 age twelve telling me i've gotta chase those dreams now i'm playing for the people dad and they know me with my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans wembley stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou i may have grown up but i hope that damien's proud and to the next generation inspiration's allowed the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow i'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me but with that said give me one more higher another one to take the sting away i am not beyond my own so here i'll stay save your lovin arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain

Nina Ed Sheeran,i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play the guitar just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder and any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder under the covers where we used to lay and re stacks is what the speakers play i’ll be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching the dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites we needed no breathe we used each others edge just for the people to see and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep we go anywhere our minds would take us and also you are beautiful without your make up and you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way god made us and time’s the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i'm away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i ain’t ever coming home nina oh won’t you leave me now and i’ve been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won’t you leave me now now and every weekend in the winter you’d be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we be on the road cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone watching blue planet creating new habits acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the borrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can’t help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you’ll be in between forever so i guess we’ll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i’m not saying we should be taking a break just re evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late so we kinda need to deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in the day we’ll have to say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i ain’t ever coming home nina oh won’t you leave me now and i’ve been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won’t you leave me now now love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won’t you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back oh oh won’t you leave me now oh nina you should go nina cause i ain’t ever coming home nina oh won’t you leave me now and i’ve been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won’t you leave me now now,Ed Sheeran,152

The A Team Ed Sheeran,white lips pale face breathing in snowflakes burnt lungs sour taste light's gone day's end struggling to pay rent long nights strange men and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us cos we're just under the upperhand and go mad for a couple of grams and she don't want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly ripped gloves raincoat tried to swim and stay afloat dry house wet clothes loose change bank notes weary eyed dry throat cool girl no phone and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us cos we're just under the upperhand and go mad for a couple of grams and she don't want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us cos we're just under the upperhand and go mad for a couple of grams and she don't want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly to fly for angels to die,Ed Sheeran,167
Take It Back Ed Sheeran,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit of spitting quicker lyrics you know you found me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in and never once i get bitten because plagiarism is hidden which i would sit on the rhythm prisoner with a vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio with a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's on to the next saga we drink the best lager i never tried to win you over like your stepfather i do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the cane like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 16 years old i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and we've been sleeping at the subway station sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't want to relax but would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now chorus come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh take it back with the rhythm and blues and my back pack i'll be singing the news trying to act like jack black when i bring him to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start it again at the end of the song still they claiming that i handled it wrong but then i never had an enemy except for nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling with respect i don't know if i'll have it this songs from the heart covering the planet i'll take it back now chorus come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh take it back now now i don't ever want to be perfect cause i'm a singer that you never want to see shirtless i accept the fact that someone's got to win the worst dressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition cause every day some lyrics and a melody can be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly i need to let my liver be and i say it again living life on the edge with a closed hand full of friends is good advice from a man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now chorus come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhymes and lies deliver the hype am i just living the lie with this you must know that the number's just sold woah will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 per cent of it when we wake but the other 10 per cent it never fades dreaming dreams day to day goals stay awake loads try to make the cut like the paper or razor blade oh never give up and just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me buskin on the street when it was cold outdoors and now i'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that posties little sister has to babysit that's just a way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the utmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or where you will be tomorrow,Ed Sheeran,168
Tenerife Ed Sheeran,you look so wonderful in your dress i love your hair like that the way it falls on the side of your neck down your shoulders and back we are surrounded by all of these lights and people who talk too much you've got that kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us and should this be the last thing i see i want you to know it's enough for me cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need i'm so in love so in love so in love so in love you look so beautiful in this light your silhouette over me the way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the tenerife sea and all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath just say the word and i will disappear into the wilderness and should this be the last thing i see i want you to know it's enough for me cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need i'm so in love so in love so in love so in love lumiere darling lumiere over me x6 and should this be the last thing i see i want you to know it's enough for me cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need i'm so in love so in love so in love love love love so in love you look so wonderful in your dress i loved your hair like that and in the moment i knew you best,Ed Sheeran,169
The Man Ed Sheeran,now i don't wanna hate you just wish you'd never gone for the man and waited two weeks at least before you let him take you i stayed true i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he's waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he's not the right guy for you don't hate me cause i write the truth no i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but f it i won't be changing the subject i love it i'll make your little secret public it's nothing i'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i'm lacking sleep fact is you're mad at me because i backtrack so casually you're practically my family if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot i think not hook i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i'm away so much i stay more celibate than in a monastery i'm not cut out for life on the road cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much and at the time we'd just go so sue me i guess i'm not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that's when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it's hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i'll ever have and need i guess i'm unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore and since you left i've given up my days off it's what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 24 7 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career and music didn't exist in 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill and i'd be writing my will before i'm 27 i'll die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing it's only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i'll be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i'm not prepared but i'll say this these things happen for a reason and you can't change shit take my apology i'm sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore,Ed Sheeran,170
